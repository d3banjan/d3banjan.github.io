<article class="post-content">
  <p>The problem with learning a mature tool/framework like <code>Qt</code> is that there is a lot of boilerplate code to be written to get to the relatively simple problem that I am trying to solve by myself. Here I try to compile a list of resources I found useful in my quest to teach myself <code>Qt</code>, with some commentary on their usefulness to my present state. There is some dearth of resources, however, that establish the organization and philosophy of <code>Qt</code> development libraries/framework/tools for beginners like me.  </p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<h3 id="video-tutorials">Video Tutorials</h3>

<p>While I did find some nice resources online, the primary one being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KtOzh0StTc&amp;list=PL2D1942A4688E9D63">the C++ Qt GUI video tutorial series by VoidRealms on YouTube</a>. What bugged me a lot was that this series relies heavily on using Qt Creator as an IDE, and that it is completely hands on and pragmatic in its approach to teaching Qt. I would have preferred being introduced to the organization of the libraries and the philosophy before diving in the tutorials and demos. </p>

<p>I also zipped through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQr3fljHizc&amp;list=PL2F919ADECA5E39A6">the C++ series by the same channel</a> which was awesome for me because I am well versed with fortran and the language features were faster to pick up here. I do not think this C++ series is a good idea for someone who is being introduced to a compiled language for the first time. This tutorial also uses Microsoft Visual Studio heavily as an IDE and would have done better without it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0D54219E5F2544D">The video tutorials by newboston on YouTube</a> were more up my alley – because of its insistence on introducing the code first and then GUI features of <code>Qt Creator</code> to accomplish that goal, or not. This is much more introductory than the one by VoidRealms. And much shorter. </p>

<h3 id="the-qt-docs">The Qt Docs</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5">official Qt documentation</a> was, surprisingly, the last place I looked for an overview of the Qt Toolchain, or atleast the toolchain that I would end up using the most later on. I would urge anyone who finds my learning path similar to their own to go through the following pages in the <code>Qt</code> Docs. I tried to write down a quick guide for looking through :  </p>

<h4 id="about-qthttpwikiqtioaboutqt"><a href="http://wiki.qt.io/About_Qt"><strong>About Qt</strong></a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Qt is a <strong>cross-platform</strong> application development framework for desktop, embedded and mobile. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best thing about <code>Qt</code> is that you can compile the same source code to run on Windows, Linux or Android. Although Graphical Elements are a large part of the <code>Qt</code> library, it provides additional tools to simplify common problems that come up in application development - like APIs for network programming, multimedia, SQL, webkit elements and widgets or unit testing.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Qt is not a programming language by its own. It is a <strong>framework</strong> written in C++.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before the compilation step, the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/moc.html">MOC(Meta-Object Compiler)</a> parses the source files written in <strong>Qt-extended C++</strong> and generates <strong>standard compliant C++</strong> sources from them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, Qt-Extended C++ <strong>—MOC—»</strong> C++ <strong>—GCC/other compiler—»</strong> Executable</p>

<h4 id="qt-moduleshttpdocqtioqt-5qtmoduleshtml"><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtmodules.html"><strong>Qt Modules</strong></a></h4>
<p>This table from the above-mentioned page on <code>Qt</code> modules is a nice resource to visualize the organization of the core modules.</p>

      <th>Description</th>

<h4 id="qt-reference-pageshttpdocqtioqt-5reference-overviewhtml"><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/reference-overview.html"><strong><code>Qt</code> reference pages</strong></a></h4>
<p>This is not a resource by itself but this is pretty good as a gateway to information that would be invaluable once we actually start using <code>Qt</code> hands on. </p>

<h4 id="examples-and-tutorialshttpdocqtioqt-5qtexamplesandtutorialshtml"><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtexamplesandtutorials.html"><strong>Examples and Tutorials</strong></a></h4>
<p>This is a similarly valuable <strong>“gateway”</strong> resource that would come in handy for reading simple blocks of understandable and well commented code later on. </p>

<h4 id="all-overviewshttpdocqtioqt-5overviewshtml"><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/overviews.html"><strong>All Overviews</strong></a></h4>
<p>This is a list of all <strong>overviews</strong>, i.e a strongly hierarchical documentation that culminates in a highly detailed page on specific topics. I would probably use these for reference and not for initial studying.</p>

<h4 id="qml-and-qt-quickhttpdocqtioqt-5qmlapplicationshtml"><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlapplications.html"><strong>QML and Qt Quick</strong></a></h4>
<p>This describes the QML language in detail that can be used for rapid protyping development as Qt Quick projects and also as an API sometimes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Qt Quick is the standard library of types and functionality for QML. It includes visual types, interactive types, animations, models and views, particle effects and shader effects. </p>
