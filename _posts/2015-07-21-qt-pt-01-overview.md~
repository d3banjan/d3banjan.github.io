The problem with learning a mature tool/framework like `Qt` is that there is a lot of boilerplate code to be written to get to the relatively simple problem that I am trying to solve by myself. Here I try to compile a list of resources I found useful in my quest to teach myself `Qt`, with some commentary on their usefulness to my present state. There is some dearth of resources, however, that establish the organization and philosophy of `Qt` development libraries/framework/tools for beginners like me.  

Resources
--------
A list of important resources follows -
 
### Video Tutorials  
x
While I did find some nice resources online, the primary one being [the C++ Qt GUI video tutorial series by VoidRealms on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KtOzh0StTc&list=PL2D1942A4688E9D63). What bugged me a lot was that this series relies heavily on using Qt Creator as an IDE, and that it is completely hands on and pragmatic in its approach to teaching Qt. I would have preferred being introduced to the organization of the libraries and the philosophy before diving in the tutorials and demos. 

I also zipped through [the C++ series by the same channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQr3fljHizc&list=PL2F919ADECA5E39A6) which was awesome for me because I am well versed with fortran and the language features were faster to pick up here. I do not think this C++ series is a good idea for someone who is being introduced to a compiled language for the first time. This tutorial also uses Microsoft Visual Studio heavily as an IDE and would have done better without it. 



[The video tutorials by newboston on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0D54219E5F2544D) were more up my alley -- because of its insistence on introducing the code first and then GUI features of `Qt Creator` to accomplish that goal, or not. This is much more introductory than the one by VoidRealms. And much shorter. 

### The Qt Docs
The [official Qt documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5) was, surprisingly, the last place I looked for an overview of the Qt Toolchain, or atleast the toolchain that I would end up using the most later on. I would urge anyone who finds my learning path similar to their own to go through the following pages in the `Qt` Docs. I tried to write down a quick guide for looking through :  

#### [**About Qt**](http://wiki.qt.io/About_Qt)
>Qt is a **cross-platform** application development framework for desktop, embedded and mobile. 

The best thing about `Qt` is that you can compile the same source code to run on Windows, Linux or Android. Although Graphical Elements are a large part of the `Qt` library, it provides additional tools to simplify common problems that come up in application development - like APIs for network programming, multimedia, SQL, webkit elements and widgets or unit testing.  

>Qt is not a programming language by its own. It is a **framework** written in C++.

> Before the compilation step, the [MOC(Meta-Object Compiler)](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/moc.html) parses the source files written in **Qt-extended C++** and generates **standard compliant C++** sources from them. 

So, Qt-Extended C++ **---MOC--->>** C++ **---GCC/other compiler--->>** Executable

#### [**Qt Modules**](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtmodules.html)
This table from the above-mentioned page on `Qt` modules is a nice resource to visualize the organization of the core modules.

|    Module	    	      |	      Description									             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|	Qt Core		      |		Core non-graphical classes used by other modules.					     |
|	Qt GUI	   	      |		Base classes for graphical user interface (GUI) components. Includes OpenGL.		     |
|	Qt Multimedia	      |		Classes for audio, video, radio and camera functionality.				     |
|	Qt Multimedia Widgets |		Widget-based classes for implementing multimedia functionality.				     |
|	Qt Network 	      |		Classes to make network programming easier and more portable.				     |
|	Qt QML	      	      |		Classes for QML and JavaScript languages.					 	     |
|	Qt Quick      	      |		A declarative framework for building highly dynamic applications with custom user interfaces.| 
|	Qt Quick Controls     |		Reusable Qt Quick based UI controls to create classic desktop-style user interfaces.	     |
|	Qt Quick Dialogs      |		Types for creating and interacting with system dialogs from a Qt Quick application.	     |
|	Qt Quick Layouts      |		Layouts are items that are used to arrange Qt Quick 2 based items in the user interface.     |
|	Qt SQL	 	      |		Classes for database integration using SQL.   	       	       	  	  	      	     |
|	Qt Test	 	      |		Classes for unit testing Qt applications and libraries.					     |
|	Qt WebKit (Deprecated)|		Classes for a WebKit2 based implementation and a QML API. Deprecated in favor of Qt WebEngine.|
|	Qt WebKit Widgets (Deprecated)|	WebKit1 and QWidget-based classes from Qt 4. 	    	       	  	      		     |
|	Qt Widgets	      |		  Classes to extend Qt GUI with C++ widgets.	    	    				     |

#### [**`Qt` reference pages**](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/reference-overview.html)
This is not a resource by itself but this is pretty good as a gateway to information that would be invaluable once we actually start using `Qt` hands on. 

#### [**Examples and Tutorials**](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtexamplesandtutorials.html)
This is a similarly valuable **"gateway"** resource that would come in handy for reading simple blocks of understandable and well commented code later on. 

#### [**All Overviews**](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/overviews.html)
This is a list of all **overviews**, i.e a strongly hierarchical documentation that culminates in a highly detailed page on specific topics. I would probably use these for reference and not for initial studying.

#### [**QML and Qt Quick**](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlapplications.html) 
This describes the QML language in detail that can be used for rapid prototyping development as Qt Quick projects and also as an API sometimes to do certain common things without writing any C++ code.

>Qt Quick is the standard library of types and functionality for QML. It includes visual types, interactive types, animations, models and views, particle effects and shader effects. 

### [**(Book) Intro to Design Patterns in C++ with Qt** ](http://www.ics.com/design-patterns)
This book was a perfect fit for my specific use case. I didn't know C++ before I wanted to learn Qt. This book uses Qt features to teach C++. This is an awesome idea because Qt makes available a lot of different functionality to the new student and you tend to write a lot less code to see an appreciable result as compared to using the Standard Library Features. This leads to easier and faster iterations, having access to Qt creator, which is a superb IDE by any standards. Especially since I have done all of the above mentioned video tutorials - I have an overview of how Qt works for some problems and that puts me at a perfect position to delve deeper and play around a bit more with the framework.
