# pdf concatenation server
while a set of articles are being downloaded (in the requisite order) at low speed because I didn't want the server to be overwhelmed, I rename the pdfs and move them to a subdirectory, and concatenate them to the same file. Over the next hour, the owncloud server updates the pdf while I read it on my ereader. :) 
### possible improvements
- if download happens in the correct order, this can be improved to a scheme where once concatenated files are not concatenated again. 
- generate makefile and create targets to create a binary tree such that updates take minimal computational effort - too  fancy! 

    set -x 
    while sleep 300 
    do for file in `find -maxdepth 1 | grep fulltext | grep -v html`
      do mv $file pdfs/$file.pdf
      done
      pdfunite pdfs/*.pdf ~/ownCloud/Documents/resonance.pdf
    done
