Hi, it is late and I'm tired. But it really feels good to make the first post after spending one whole hour at making this blog happen.  

## Resolutions   

This would be my list of TO-DO posts[^foot1] for the first week of return to blogging:

* describe the sheer joy of purpose in using git [^foot2]
* describe how I set up this blog by borrowing bits and pieces of technology available to me -- some of them turned out to be quite interesting choices to make. The topics I can see right now are:
   + markdown
   + jekyll
   +  github and github-pages
   + adapting a standard jekyll-theme (like me)
* do a funny post about cats (_sic_ Humorous)

[^foot1]: I have been away from blogging for too long, the first few would be a bit techy! 
[^foot2]: atleast the subset of it that I use


Night night!
