সাত ভাই চম্পা (*Saat Bhai Champa*, "Seven Brothers Champa").

You heard it from your grandmother. Or from hers. A queen buries seven boys in the garden — her stepsons, the living proof of her husband's first marriage — and they grow up through the soil as champā flowers. Their mother comes each evening and calls to them, and the flowers bend toward her voice. The stepmother tries to pick them. They won't be picked.

The story has a name for the flower at its centre: চম্পা (*champa*). The flower that smells like the monsoon before it breaks. The flower that refuses to be owned.

Now here is the strange thing I want to sit with today: *champa* sounds like Sanskrit. It *is* in Sanskrit — *campaka* — one of the most common flowers in classical Hindu and Buddhist poetry. Kalidasa uses it. The Mahabharata mentions it. Every Sanskrit lexicographer who lived within smelling distance of eastern India knew this flower.

But *campaka* is almost certainly not *from* Sanskrit. Sanskrit borrowed it. And the people it borrowed it from may be the very people the word survived to describe.

## The Flower That Is Not in the Rigveda

When scholars want to know whether a Sanskrit word is genuinely Proto-Indo-Aryan or whether Sanskrit absorbed it from another language, one of the first questions they ask is: does it appear in the Rigveda?

The Rigveda is old — composed somewhere in the Punjab or the Sapta Sindhu region, probably between 1500 and 1200 BCE, before the Aryan-speaking populations had moved far into the Gangetic plains. Its vocabulary is the earliest stratum we can access. Words for things that existed in that northwestern world are there. Words for things encountered *later*, as these populations moved east and south, tend not to be.

*Campaka* does not appear in the Rigveda.

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="campaka" bengali="চাঁপা" meaning="champak flower (Magnolia champaca); absent from Rigveda; enters attested Sanskrit only in the Epic and Classical periods" */}

It enters attested Sanskrit texts only in the Epic and Classical periods — roughly the last few centuries BCE through the first millennium CE. This is exactly when Aryan-speaking populations were expanding east into the Gangetic plains and beyond, into the zone where the champak tree actually grows.

The champak (*Magnolia champaca*, formerly *Michelia champaca*) is a tree native to eastern India and mainland Southeast Asia. Its natural range runs from the eastern slopes of the Himalayas down through Bengal, Assam, and Odisha, continuing into Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. This is the Austroasiatic world — the landscape of the Munda peoples, the Mon-Khmer speakers, the ancestors of communities now pushed to the margins of South Asia.

The word *champa* almost certainly existed in this landscape before Sanskrit arrived. Sanskrit borrowed it from whoever was already there.

The irony is recursive: the Bengali folk tale uses a Sanskrit-sounding word that Sanskrit borrowed from the pre-Aryan eastern peoples whose descendants were being displaced by the civilization that brought Sanskrit. The oldest thing in the story is the thing that sounds most literary.

## The Story Properly Told

সাত ভাই চম্পা belongs to *Thakurmar Jhuli* ("Grandmother's Bag"), the 1907 collection by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder — the Bengali equivalent of the Brothers Grimm in ambition, though the tales he collected were old before he found them.

The plot follows what folklorists call ATU 707, an international tale type found across Eurasia from Ireland to the Philippines. The basic structure — miraculous children, jealous rival, transformation, eventual recognition — recurs in tales from Italy, Germany, Arabia. ATU 707 has been wandering across human cultures for a very long time, and no single region owns it.

What each culture contributes is the specific flora of transformation. In the Bengali version, the children become চম্পা flowers. This is the local botanical adaptation — the element that roots this particular telling in this particular landscape, the eastern riverine world where champak trees grew dense and fragrant along the banks of the Brahmaputra, the Padma, the Bhagirathi.

The political reading of the tale is not difficult. A king's legitimate heirs are buried alive by a rival faction — the stepmother and her allies — but they refuse to disappear. They keep calling out to their mother. They refuse to be picked by the wrong hands. The mother recognizes them even in their transformed state. Eventually they are restored.

Succession anxiety. Clandestine assassination of heirs. The resilience of legitimate lineages even under suppression. The choice of transformation matters: the children become something *rooted*, something that *speaks to its own*, something that cannot be transplanted by force. The champak is not a flower you can pick without permission. The story knows this about it.

## Four Champas, One Word

There are four distinct things that share this name, and their relationship to one another ranges from clear etymology to genuine mystery. I want to be honest about what is established and what is speculation.

**The first Champa: the flower.**

চাঁপা (*chãpa*), *campaka* in Sanskrit. Fragrant, pale yellow-gold, sacred in both Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Native range: eastern India through mainland Southeast Asia. Almost certainly a loanword into Sanskrit from the pre-Aryan eastern substrate — Munda, or another language family of the same zone. This one we can say with reasonable confidence.

**The second Champa: the city in Anga.**

*Campā* was the capital of Aṅga, one of the sixteen *janapadas* (kingdoms) of the ancient Gangetic world. Its location is near modern Bhagalpur in Bihar — in the territory where the river bends east toward Bengal. The Aitareya Brahmana characterises Aṅga as non-Aryan territory: the Aṅga king is described as impure for having lived east of the Sadanira, the boundary beyond which even Agni the fire god refused to travel.

The city named *Campā* stood in explicitly pre-Aryan territory. Whether the city was named after the flower, or the flower's name was already embedded in the landscape before either the city or the Sanskrit word were formalised — this is contested and may not be resolvable. What matters: the champak's native range, the pre-Aryan territory, and the city called Campā all overlap in the same geography of eastern Bihar and western Bengal.

Today, this territory is home to speakers of Angika — a living language with somewhere between six and twelve million speakers, depending on whose count you trust. It does not appear as a separate language in the Indian census; its speakers are counted as Hindi speakers, their language dissolved administratively into a category it does not belong to. The old capital of a kingdom the Aitareya Brahmana called non-Aryan stands in the territory of people whose language the Indian state declines to acknowledge.

**The third Champa: the Santal homeland.**

Chae Champa is the golden city in Santal oral tradition — the great pre-migration homeland described in the *Horkoren Mare Hapramko Reak Katha*, the migration epic we discussed in Post 4. In Santali, *champa* is the champak flower — borrowed from Sanskrit or Bengali. But the *place* called Chae Champa overlaps with ancient Anga territory: the Santal historical homeland and the landscape of Anga are the same geography. The Munda and related peoples remember living in the lands that were later described as Anga. The golden city and the non-Aryan kingdom occupy the same coordinates in historical memory.

**The fourth Champa: the kingdom in Vietnam.**

The Kingdom of Champa existed in what is now central and southern Vietnam from approximately 192 CE to 1832 CE. Its people, the Cham, built extraordinary Hindu temples that still stand at My Son and Dong Duong.

Here I have to make a distinction that matters: the Cham people speak an **Austronesian** language — related to Malay, Javanese, and the languages of the Philippines, not to the Munda or Mon-Khmer families. They are not descendants of the Austroasiatic world that produced the Munda substrate in Bengali. Linguistically, they belong to a separate branch.

The name "Champa" for the Vietnamese kingdom almost certainly derives from Sanskrit *campaka* adopted as a prestige name through Indianisation — the process by which Sanskrit culture spread across Southeast Asia in the first millennium CE. There may be an indigenous Cham root *cam* (an ethnic self-designation) that the Sanskrit name mapped onto.

The claim sometimes made in popular historiography — that Jataka tales describe merchants from the Anga city of Campā sailing east to found the Vietnamese Champa — does not survive scrutiny of the actual Jataka texts. It is not there.

What *is* documented: a Cham inscription from the highland trading post of Po Nagar mentions *vaṅgalā* merchants — Bengali traders — active in the Champa highlands. Bengal was connected to maritime Southeast Asia through actual ships and actual exchange, running at least as far back as the mid-first millennium BCE. Carnelian beads manufactured at Wari-Bateshwar in what is now Bangladesh have been found in the Philippines and Indonesia. The connection is real. It runs through trade, not through a founding myth.

## The Resonance and Its Limits

The resonance between the four Champas is real and worth sitting with. A pre-Aryan word for a fragrant flower, native to the eastern margins of the subcontinent. A pre-Aryan city in Bihar bearing that name. A Munda golden homeland remembered as Chae Champa, located in the same landscape. A Southeast Asian kingdom named, via Sanskrit, after the same flower — a kingdom with which Bengali merchants traded.

Its exact mechanism — coincidence, convergence, or common origin — is still being reconstructed by historical linguists. Whether *campaka* is specifically a Munda substrate word or comes from another pre-Aryan language family of the same zone is contested. The "substrate convergence" hypothesis connecting all four Champas is genuinely interesting, but it is a hypothesis, not a settled conclusion.

What I am more confident in: the word *champa* is old in the eastern landscape in a way that predates its Sanskrit wrapping. The folk tale draws on a botanical reality that belongs specifically to the Austroasiatic world, even if it came to your grandmother's lips via Sanskrit and centuries of cultural transmission.

The ATU 707 tale type traveled across Eurasia. But the children in your grandmother's story grew back as *champa* flowers, not apple blossoms or water lilies or any of the things they become in other tellings. Someone looked at the landscape of eastern India and chose the champak as the right flower for this particular transformation. That choice is the local knowledge. That choice is where the deep time lives.

## What the Flower Refuses

সাত ভাই চম্পা knew what it was saying.

The children become something rooted. They speak to their own. They refuse to be picked by the wrong hands. And the word at the center of the story — the word your grandmother said, the word that sounds most Sanskrit, the word that appears in Kalidasa — is almost certainly not Sanskrit at all. It is a pre-Aryan word for a pre-Aryan tree, borrowed by Sanskrit from the people who were already living in the landscape where that tree grew.

The oldest thing in the story is the thing that sounds most literary.

The flower grows back. It outlasted the language that named it, and the empire that borrowed the name, and the kingdom in Vietnam that adopted it as a prestige title. It is still fragrant. It still refuses to be picked by the wrong hands.
