<div class="lang-en">

আগডুম বাগডুম (*Agadom Bagadom*). You clapped hands to it as a child. You probably had a partner — your palms meeting theirs in an alternating rhythm, faster and faster until someone lost the beat. The words themselves meant nothing. That was the point. They were just sounds, just the pleasure of a galloping pattern, just noise.

They aren't noise.

This post is about what Bengali children's rhymes — ছড়া (*chhora*) — are actually doing. About why a community that could no longer celebrate its martial history publicly hid it inside a hand-clapping game. About how the 1740s Maratha raids on Bengal got compressed into a lullaby. About the oldest layer of all: rain-calling chants that may be the most direct line we have to pre-Indo-Aryan ritual speech.

The "nonsense" in Bengali nursery rhymes is load-bearing. The meter is a container. And when keeping explicit records becomes politically dangerous, the most resilient container available turns out to be: what children chant while playing.

## Agadom Bagadom: The Cavalry in the Game

Here is the full rhyme, the way it is usually transmitted:

> আগডুম বাগডুম ঘোড়াডুম সাজে
> ঢাক ঢোল ঝাঁঝর বাজে
> বাজতে বাজতে চলল ঘোড়া
> গড়ের মাঠে করল ভোরা।
>
> *Agadom bagadom ghoradom saje*
> *Dhak dhol jhaanjhor baje*
> *Bajte bajte cholo ghora*
> *Gorer mathe korlo bhora.*
>
> "Agadom bagadom, the horses parade / Drums and cymbals and gongs are played / The horses march onward to drumbeat's call / They fill the parade ground, one and all."

Now stop treating the first word as nonsense and look at it: *Agadom Bagadom*. The *-dom* suffix. *Bāg-dom*. *Dom*.

Dom (ডোম, *Dom*) is the name of a real community — the Dom people, with deep roots across the Austroasiatic and Dravidian substrate of eastern India. Closely related are the Bagdi (বাগদী, *Bagdi*) — traditional fishermen and cultivators of the Bengal delta who claimed *Barga Kshatriya* (warrior-caste) status and whose men were renowned as *lathials* (bamboo-staff martial artists). Both communities served as elite infantry and cavalry under the Pala and Sena empires — the dynasties that ruled Bengal from the eighth to the twelfth centuries CE. They were the people who filled the parade ground. The *Gorer math* (গড়ের মাঠ, *gorer math*, "the fort's field") is a specific place: the maidan around a military garrison.

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="lathial" bengali="লাঠিয়াল" meaning="a stick-fighter, traditionally hired as armed escort or guard; the lathi is the bamboo staff" */}

The hand-clapping rhythm of *Agadom Bagadom* is not arbitrary. The alternating-palm pattern, accelerating, mimics cavalry drill — hooves on packed earth, the rhythmic percussion of a mounted unit moving at speed. The ঢাক ঢোল ঝাঁঝর (*dhak dhol jhaanjhor*, "drum, drum, and cymbal") are the percussion instruments of a military column on the march. This is acoustic mimicry. The children playing this game are, unknowingly, rehearsing the sound of an army.

### Why It Had to Be Hidden

The Dom and Bagdi communities lost their military status and land base not through battlefield defeat but through an administrative act: the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.

Under this colonial legislation, the British government designated entire communities as "hereditary criminals" — people whose criminality was not individual but biological, a birth trait rather than a choice. The Dom, Bagdi, and dozens of other communities whose pre-British occupation had been martial or nomadic were placed on this list. The consequences were immediate and severe: adult males were required to register with local police, report for roll calls, and obtain passes before traveling. Children between six and eighteen could be removed from their families and placed in government "reform institutions." Families could be relocated to penal colonies.

In a single generation, a community that had served as royal cavalry became a community whose every movement was tracked by the colonial state. They could not gather. They could not celebrate their martial heritage. Any public display of the traditions that had made them militarily valuable — the lathi fighting, the horse culture, the drum-centered ritual life — invited legal action.

So they hid it in a game.

The hand-clapping rhyme was socially invisible. No one interrogates what children do at play. No magistrate can arrest a group of children for playing *Agadom Bagadom*. The meter protected the phonology; the playground protected the practitioners; and the "nonsense" of *agadom bagadom* — sounding close enough to meaninglessness that it would not attract attention — protected the content.

The *Agadom Bagadom* we clapped as children was at least partly a memory of people who were no longer legally permitted to remember who they were.

## Khoka Ghumolo: The Lullaby of the Invasion

Here is a second rhyme, this one a lullaby — something sung to put a child to sleep:

> খোকা ঘুমলো পাড়া জুড়লো বর্গী এলো দেশে
> বুলবুলিতে ধান খেয়েছে খাজনা দেবো কিসে।
> ধান ফুরলো পান ফুরলো খাজনার উপায় কি
> আর কটা দিন সবুর করো রসুন বুনেছি।
>
> *Khoka ghumolo para jurolo Bargi elo deshe*
> *Bulbulite dhan kheyeche khajona debo kise.*
> *Dhan phurolo pan phurolo khajonar upay ki*
> *Ar kota din shobur koro roshun bunechhi.*
>
> "The child sleeps, the neighbourhood hushes, the Bargis have come to the land —
> The bulbul birds ate the rice, with what shall we pay our tax?
> The rice is gone, the betel is gone — what hope of paying now?
> Wait a few more days, I planted garlic."

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="bargi" bengali="বর্গী" meaning="Maratha cavalry raider; from Marathi bargir, a mounted soldier" */}

*Bārgi* (বর্গী, *bārgi*): from Marathi *bārgīr*, a mounted soldier paid wages rather than given land. In Bengal, the word became specific to Maratha raiders — the forces of Raghoji Bhonsle, who launched devastating cavalry raids across western and central Bengal repeatedly through the 1740s and into the 1750s. Villages were looted. Crops were burned. People fled. The raids became a generational trauma encoded in the Bengali phrase *Maratha danga* — "the Maratha terror."

The lullaby is a document of that terror. The rice is gone — the raidershave taken or burned the harvest. The betel is gone — even the domestic perennial is depleted. The tax is still due (the Nawab of Bengal, under whose jurisdiction this was all happening, continued collecting revenue regardless of the raids). The mother planting garlic at the end of the poem is the punchline and the gut-punch: in the ruins of the harvest, she is buying time with a root crop that takes months to mature. Wait a few more days. I planted garlic.

What makes *Khoka Ghumolo* remarkable is the bitter irony of its framing. It is a lullaby. Its function is to soothe a child to sleep. Its content is a description of complete material ruin, invasion, the impossibility of paying taxes, and the desperate optimism of planting garlic when everything else is gone. Historical violence compressed into a bedtime rhythm. The child falls asleep to the cadence of their own community's catastrophe.

This is the eighteenth-century layer of Bengali folk memory. *Agadom Bagadom* is potentially medieval or ancient — encoded in the pre-colonial martial culture of the Dom and Bagdi communities that stretch back through the Pala and Sena empires. *Khoka Ghumolo* is precisely dated: the Bargi raids were 1741–1751. Two rhymes, two depths in the same archive.

## Ay Brishti Jhepe: The Oldest Layer

Now the third rhyme, and the one that may go deepest:

> আয় বৃষ্টি ঝেঁপে ধান দেবো মেপে
> আয় বৃষ্টি ঝেঁপে।
>
> *Ay brishti jhepe, dhan debo mepe*
> *Ay brishti jhepe.*
>
> "Come, rain, pour down — I'll give you rice by measure
> Come, rain, pour down."

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="jhepe" bengali="ঝেঁপে" meaning="pouring down heavily — onomatopoeic, non-Sanskrit; possibly substrate" */}

This is the simplest of the three, and possibly the oldest. *Ay brishti jhepe* is a rain-calling chant — sung by children running outside during the first rains of the monsoon, a practice still found in rural Bengal. The child offers rice in exchange for rain. The rain is addressed directly, as a presence that can be bargained with.

The word *jhepe* (ঝেঁপে) is important: it is onomatopoeic, describing the sound and weight of heavy rainfall. It has no clean Sanskrit etymology. It is a *deshi* word — one of those "of-the-land" words that Bengali uses without being able to trace the path home. Its *jh-* onset puts it in the phonological neighborhood we explored in the first post: the cluster of words (*jhol*, *jhal*, *jhar*, *jhinge*) that may be Munda substrate inheritances.

But what matters here is not just the word. It is the *practice*. The ritualized addressing of rain, the offer of grain in exchange for weather, the participation of children as ritual agents — this is a form of agricultural propitiation that has parallels in Munda and Santal ritual life. Santal communities have detailed rain-making ceremonies: the *rain-calling* is a community act, led by designated ritual specialists, involving song, offering, and invocation of specific deities or forces.

The Bengali children's rhyme is the vestige — attenuated, playful, decontextualized — of something that was once a serious collective ritual. The content traveled; the context was lost. What remained was a children's game. The *practice* of ritually invoking rain through rhymed chant is almost certainly much older than the Bengali text. It may be one of the most direct lines we have to pre-Indo-Aryan agricultural ritual speech.

## Why Rhymes Survive When Records Don't

I want to step back and name the mechanism, because it appears across cultures and deserves a name.

Fixed-form oral compositions survive where open-form records do not. There are four reasons specific to children's rhymes:

**They are memorized before critical awareness.** A child learning *Agadom Bagadom* is not evaluating it. They are absorbing it through repetition, rhythm, and the pleasure of the game. By the time they might critically examine the words, the words are already inside them, along with the rhythmic groove that carries them.

**They are transmitted by repetition, not comprehension.** The meaning can erode completely — and often does — while the phonological form stays intact. *Agadom bagadom* means nothing recognizable to most Bengali children today. The meaning has been forgotten. The sounds remain. The meter remains. The hand-clapping pattern remains. The transmission continued not because anyone understood what was being transmitted but because the *form* was pleasurable.

**They are socially unmarked.** No colonial magistrate looked at children playing *Agadom Bagadom* and saw a problem. No reformist pande worried about what the children were saying. Children's games are invisible to power in a way that adult speech acts are not. This invisibility is protective.

**The meter is armor.** Metrically constrained text resists change at every transmission. If the syllable count is wrong, the rhyme breaks; if the rhyme breaks, the game doesn't work; if the game doesn't work, the child corrects it. The music is conservative. The meter holds the phonology in place even as meaning dissolves. This is why prayers and liturgy survive: fixed form resists drift. The same mechanism works in children's games, but without the prestige that might attract reformist attention — which makes the game *more* resilient in some ways than scripture, because nobody tries to "improve" it.

## The Maithili Thread

A brief note on a parallel tradition that shows the Bengali ছড়া (*chhora*) is not an isolated phenomenon but part of a broader eastern Indian folk-literary ecology.

Maithili — the language of Mithila, in what is now northern Bihar — has a folk poetry tradition that is strikingly parallel to Bengali's. The *Barahmasi* (বারমাসি, *baramasi*, "twelve months") form: poems or songs that move through the agricultural calendar month by month, recording the changing work, the changing emotions, the changing weather. You find it in Maithili. You find it in Bengali. You find it in Odia. The form is eastern Indo-Aryan, not specifically Bengali — it is the literary expression of a rice-farming civilization that lives by the monsoon calendar.

The great Maithili poet Vidyapati — who wrote in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries — composed devotional lyrics (*padāvalī*) in his native Maithili that are today sung in Bengali homes during Durga Puja. These songs were adopted into Bengali devotional practice so completely that most people who sing them do not know they are singing Maithili, not Bengali. Linguistically, the two languages are close enough — both descended from Māgadhī Prākrit, both in the eastern Indo-Aryan family — that the songs travel between them with minimal friction.

This is not cultural appropriation in any invidious sense. It is the natural porosity of languages that share a root, spoken by communities that share a climate, an agricultural cycle, and a deep history. The eastern Indo-Aryan zone — Bengali, Assamese, Maithili, Magahi, Odia — was never a collection of sealed national cultures. It was a dialect continuum, a shared literary ecosystem, a region in the deep-time sense that no modern state boundary accurately captures.

*Agadom Bagadom* and *Khoka Ghumolo* and *Ay Brishti Jhepe* are Bengali in the sense that they are transmitted in Bengali. They are eastern in the deeper sense that their logic — of encoding, of memory, of agricultural propitiation — belongs to the whole plateau.

## What We Are Carrying

I want to end with something simple.

The next time you clap through *Agadom Bagadom* with a child — or remember doing so — consider what is actually happening in the transmission. The rhythm in your palms is the acoustic memory of cavalry on a parade ground, from a community whose martial identity was administratively destroyed in 1871. The children who first played this game probably understood what *Bāgdom* meant. Their grandchildren were less sure. Their great-grandchildren had forgotten entirely. But the rhythm stayed. The form stayed. The game stayed.

Memory is strange. It does not always know it is remembering. It carries things forward in containers that have been emptied of their original contents — and then fills those containers with new meaning, or no meaning, or just sound.

But the thing being carried is still there. In the palm-clap. In the lullaby. In the rain-calling chant with the non-Sanskrit word for downpour.

The most resilient archive in Bengal is not in the British Library. It is in the playground.

আগডুম বাগডুম। ছোটবেলায় এই ছড়া কেটে হাততালি দিয়ে খেলেননি, এমন বাঙালি বোধহয় খুঁজলেও পাওয়া যাবে না। উল্টোদিকের সাথিটির সাথে তাল মিলিয়ে হাতের চেটোয় চেটোয় বাড়ি, আর গতি ক্রমশ বাড়তে থাকা—যতক্ষণ না দুজনের একজন তাল কাটে। ছড়ার শব্দগুলোর তো কোনো মাথামুন্ডু নেই, আর সেখানেই তো খেলার আসল মজা। স্রেফ একটা ছন্দ, একটা ছুটন্ত ঘোড়ার মতো দুলকি চালের মজা, শুধুই কিছু শব্দের কোলাহল। তাই তো?

আজ্ঞে না। 

আমাদের আজকের এই ঘ্যানঘ্যানানিটা আসলে বাংলার শিশুদের এই নিরীহ ছড়াগুলোকে নিয়েই। কেন একটা আস্ত সম্প্রদায়, যারা এককালে বীরদর্পে যুদ্ধ করত, তারা তাদের সেই গৌরবময় সামরিক ইতিহাসকে স্রেফ একটা হাততালির খেলার মধ্যে লুকিয়ে ফেলতে বাধ্য হয়েছিল? কীভাবে ১৭৪০-এর দশকের সেই ভয়ংকর মারাঠা আক্রমণ সংকুচিত হয়ে ঢুকে পড়ল একটা ঘুমপাড়ানি গানের ভেতরে? আর সবচেয়ে পুরনো যে স্তরটা—বৃষ্টি ডাকার সেই আদিম মন্ত্র, যা হয়তো প্রাক-ইন্দো-আর্য যুগের আচার-অনুষ্ঠানের সবচেয়ে সরাসরি প্রমাণ—সেসব নিয়েই আজকের আড্ডা।

বাংলার এই ছেলেভুলানো ছড়াগুলোর ওই "অর্থহীন" বাউন্ডুলেপনাটাই আসলে এক-একটা ইতিহাসের ভার বহন করে চলেছে। ছন্দটা হলো একটা আস্তরণ, একটা খোলস বা কন্টেইনার। আর যখন লিখিত ইতিহাস রাখাটা রাজনৈতিকভাবে বিপজ্জনক হয়ে দাঁড়ায়, তখন এই ইতিহাস বাঁচিয়ে রাখার সবচেয়ে মজবুত সিন্দুকটা কী জানেন? বাচ্চারা খেলার ছলে যা মুখে মুখে ঘোরে, ঠিক সেটাই।

### আগডুম বাগডুম: খেলার আড়ালে অশ্বারোহী বাহিনী

পুরো ছড়াটা ঠিক যেভাবে যুগ যুগ ধরে মুখে মুখে ফিরেছে, সেটা একবার দেখা যাক:

আগডুম বাগডুম ঘোড়াডুম সাজে   
ঢাক ঢোল ঝাঁঝর বাজে  
বাজতে বাজতে চলল ঘোড়া  
গড়ের মাঠে করল ভোরা।

এবার ওই প্রথম শব্দটার "অর্থহীনতা" একটু সরিয়ে রেখে ভালো করে তাকান দিকি। *আগডুম বাগডুম*। শেষের ওই '-ডুম' প্রত্যয়টা। বাগ-ডুম। ডোম।

ডোম\! হ্যাঁ, ঠিকই ধরেছেন। পূর্ব ভারতের অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক এবং দ্রাবিড় জনজাতির (substrate) গভীরে শিকড় গেড়ে থাকা একটা সত্যিকারের সম্প্রদায়। আর এদেরই খুব কাছাকাছি আরেকটা জনজাতি হলো বাগদী—বাংলার বদ্বীপ অঞ্চলের ঐতিহ্যবাহী জেলে এবং চাষি, যারা নিজেদের 'বর্গ ক্ষত্রিয়' বলে দাবি করত। এই বাগদী সম্প্রদায়ের পুরুষরা আবার লাঠিয়াল হিসেবে ছিল দারুণ নামডাকওয়ালা। অষ্টম থেকে দ্বাদশ শতাব্দীতে পাল ও সেন রাজবংশের আমলে এই ডোম আর বাগদীরাই ছিল রাজকীয় পদাতিক আর অশ্বারোহী বাহিনীর এলিট সেনাদল। এরাই সেই লোক, যারা গড়ের মাঠ ভরিয়ে তুলত (গড়ের মাঠ মানে তো সামরিক গ্যারিসনের বা দুর্গের আশেপাশের ময়দান, তাই না?)।

আর ওই যে হাততালি দেওয়ার ছন্দ, ওটা কিন্তু খেয়ালের বশে তৈরি হয়নি। হাতের চেটোয় চেটোয় বাড়ি মারার ওই যে ক্রমশ বাড়তে থাকা তাল, ওটা আসলে অশ্বারোহী বাহিনীর কুচকাওয়াজের একেবারে নিখুঁত শব্দনকল (acoustic mimicry)। শক্ত মাটির ওপর ঘোড়ার খুরের শব্দ, একটা ছুটন্ত অশ্বারোহী দলের তালবদ্ধ আওয়াজ। ঢাক, ঢোল, ঝাঁঝর—এগুলো তো সামরিক বাহিনীর মার্চ করার সময়ের বাদ্যযন্ত্র। বাচ্চারা যখন এই খেলাটা খেলছে, তারা কিন্তু নিজের অজান্তেই একটা আস্ত সেনাবাহিনীর কুচকাওয়াজের মহড়া দিচ্ছে\!

#### কেন এটা লুকাতে হলো?

এই ডোম আর বাগদী সম্প্রদায় কিন্তু যুদ্ধক্ষেত্রে হেরে গিয়ে তাদের সামরিক মর্যাদা বা জমিজমা হারায়নি। তাদের এই পরিণতি হয়েছিল স্রেফ একটা প্রশাসনিক কলমের খোঁচায়: ১৮৭১ সালের 'ক্রিমিনাল ট্রাইবস অ্যাক্ট' বা অপরাধী উপজাতি আইন।

ব্রিটিশ সরকারের এই ঔপনিবেশিক আইনের আওতায় আস্ত এক-একটা সম্প্রদায়কে "জন্মগত অপরাধী" তকমা দিয়ে দেওয়া হলো। অর্থাৎ তাদের অপরাধ কোনো ব্যক্তিগত কাজ নয়, সেটা যেন তাদের রক্তে মেশা, জন্মগত একটা বৈশিষ্ট্য\! ডোম, বাগদী থেকে শুরু করে আরও বহু সম্প্রদায়—ব্রিটিশরা আসার আগে যাদের পেশা ছিল সামরিক বা যাযাবর বৃত্তির—তারা সবাই এই কালো তালিকায় ঢুকে পড়ল। এর ফল হলো ভয়ংকর: প্রাপ্তবয়স্ক পুরুষদের স্থানীয় থানায় নাম লেখাতে হতো, রোজ হাজিরা দিতে হতো, আর কোথাও যাওয়ার আগে পাস জোগাড় করতে হতো। ছয় থেকে আঠারো বছরের বাচ্চাদের তাদের পরিবার থেকে কেড়ে নিয়ে সরকারি "সংশোধনাগারে" পাঠানো শুরু হলো। অনেক পরিবারকে তুলে নিয়ে গিয়ে সোজা নির্বাসন বা পেনাল কলোনিতে ফেলা হলো।

ভাবুন অবস্থাটা\! মাত্র এক প্রজন্মের ব্যবধানে যে সম্প্রদায় এককালে রাজকীয় অশ্বারোহী বাহিনী হিসেবে দাপিয়ে বেড়াত, তাদের প্রতিটি নড়াচড়ার ওপর নজরদারি শুরু করল ঔপনিবেশিক রাষ্ট্রযন্ত্র। তারা আর একজোট হতে পারত না। নিজেদের সামরিক ঐতিহ্যের কোনো উৎসব পালন করতে পারত না। লাঠিখেলা, ঘোড়ার কসরত বা ঢাকঢোল বাজিয়ে কোনো আচার-অনুষ্ঠান—যেগুলো একসময় তাদের সামরিক অহংকার ছিল—তার বিন্দুমাত্র প্রকাশ্যে এলেই জুটত আইনি খাঁড়া।

তাই বাধ্য হয়ে তারা তাদের এই ঐতিহ্যকে লুকিয়ে ফেলল একটা খেলার ভেতরে।

বাচ্চাদের এই হাততালি দিয়ে ছড়া কাটার ব্যাপারটা ছিল সমাজের চোখে একেবারে অদৃশ্য। বাচ্চারা খেলার মাঠে কী করছে, তা নিয়ে কেউ মাথা ঘামায় না। কোনো জাঁদরেল ব্রিটিশ ম্যাজিস্ট্রেট তো আর একদল হাফপ্যান্ট পরা বাচ্চাকে 'আগডুম বাগডুম' খেলার অপরাধে গারদে পুরতে পারে না\! ছন্দের আংটায় শব্দগুলো সুরক্ষিত রইল; খেলার মাঠ সুরক্ষিত রাখল সেই ঐতিহ্যকে; আর ওই যে "আগডুম বাগডুম" শব্দগুলোর আপাত-অর্থহীনতা—যাতে কেউ ঘুণাক্ষরেও সন্দেহ না করে—তা নিখুঁতভাবে রক্ষা করল ভেতরের আসল ইতিহাসটাকে।

ছোটবেলায় যে 'আগডুম বাগডুম' বলে আমরা হাততালি দিতাম, তা আসলে এমন কিছু মানুষের টুকরো স্মৃতি, যাদের আইনিভাবে নিজেদের পরিচয় মনে রাখারই কোনো অধিকার ছিল না।

### খোকা ঘুমলো: বর্গী হানার ঘুমপাড়ানি গান

এবার আসা যাক দ্বিতীয় ছড়াটায়, এটা একটা ঘুমপাড়ানি গান—বাচ্চাদের ঘুম পাড়ানোর অব্যর্থ ওষুধ:

খোকা ঘুমলো  
পাড়া জুড়লো  
বর্গী এলো দেশে  
বুলবুলিতে ধান খেয়েছে  
খাজনা দেবো কিসে।  
ধান ফুরলো পান ফুরলো  
খাজনার উপায় কি  
আর কটা দিন সবুর করো  
রসুন বুনেছি।

বর্গী: শব্দটা এসেছে মারাঠি *bārgīr* থেকে, যার মানে হলো এমন একজন অশ্বারোহী সেনা যাকে জমির বদলে নগদ মাইনে দেওয়া হতো। তবে বাংলায় এই শব্দটা মারাঠা লুঠেরাদের সমার্থক হয়ে দাঁড়ায়—বিশেষ করে রঘুজী ভোঁসলের সেই অশ্বারোহী বাহিনী, যারা ১৭৪০ এবং ৫০-এর দশক জুড়ে বারবার পশ্চিম ও মধ্য বাংলায় ভয়ংকর ধ্বংসলীলা চালিয়েছিল। গ্রামকে গ্রাম লুঠ হয়েছিল। ফসল পুড়িয়ে দেওয়া হয়েছিল। মানুষ প্রাণের ভয়ে পালিয়েছিল। এই আক্রমণগুলো প্রজন্মের পর প্রজন্ম ধরে এমন একটা ট্রমা তৈরি করেছিল, যা বাংলা ভাষায় চিরস্থায়ী হয়ে গেছে "মারাঠা দাঙ্গা" শব্দবন্ধের মধ্যে দিয়ে।

এই ঘুমপাড়ানি গানটা আসলে সেই আতঙ্কেরই একটা দলিল। ধান ফুরিয়েছে—মানে লুঠেরারা ফসল নিয়ে গেছে বা জ্বালিয়ে দিয়েছে। পান ফুরিয়েছে—এমনকি বাড়ির আঙিনায় বোনা রোজকার গাছপালাও শেষ। কিন্তু খাজনা ঠিকই দিতে হবে (কারণ বাংলার নবাব, যার রাজত্বে এসব ঘটছিল, তিনি এই লুঠতরাজের মধ্যেও নিয়ম করে রাজস্ব আদায় চালিয়ে যাচ্ছিলেন)। কবিতার শেষে ওই যে মা রসুন বুনছেন, ওটাই হলো সবচেয়ে বড় ট্র্যাজেডি এবং একইসঙ্গে মরিয়া আশাবাদ: ফসলের এই ধ্বংসস্তূপের মাঝে দাঁড়িয়ে তিনি এমন একটা মূলজাতীয় ফসল বুনে সময় কেনার চেষ্টা করছেন, যা ফলতে কয়েক মাস সময় লাগবে। আর কটা দিন সবুর করো। আমি রসুন বুনেছি।

ভেবে দেখুন তো, কী অদ্ভুত একটা বৈপরীত্য\! এটা একটা ঘুমপাড়ানি গান। এর কাজ হলো একটা কচি বাচ্চাকে শান্ত করে ঘুম পাড়ানো। আর এর ভেতরে কী লেখা আছে? চূড়ান্ত ধ্বংস, আক্রমণ, খাজনা মেটানোর চরম অসহায়তা, আর সবকিছু শেষ হয়ে যাওয়ার পর রসুন বোনার একটা মরিয়া চেষ্টা। ইতিহাসের চরমতম হিংসা সংকুচিত হয়ে ঢুকে গেছে একটা ঘুমের ছন্দে। নিজের সম্প্রদায়ের সবচেয়ে ভয়ংকর বিপর্যয়ের গল্প শুনতে শুনতে একটা বাচ্চা ঘুমিয়ে পড়ছে।

এটা হলো বাঙালি লোকস্মৃতির অষ্টাদশ শতাব্দীর স্তর। 'আগডুম বাগডুম' হয়তো মধ্যযুগীয় বা প্রাচীন—ডোম ও বাগদী সম্প্রদায়ের প্রাক-ঔপনিবেশিক সামরিক সংস্কৃতির কোড, যা পাল ও সেন সাম্রাজ্য অবধি পিছিয়ে যায়। আর 'খোকা ঘুমলো'র একটা নির্দিষ্ট সময়কাল আছে: বর্গী হানা হয়েছিল ১৭৪১-১৭৫১ সালের মধ্যে। একই আর্কাইভে দুটো ছড়া, ইতিহাসের দুটো আলাদা গভীরতা।

### আয় বৃষ্টি ঝেঁপে: সবচেয়ে প্রাচীন স্তর

এবার তৃতীয় ছড়াটা, আর এটাই হয়তো সবচেয়ে গভীরে প্রোথিত:

আয় বৃষ্টি ঝেঁপে ধান দেবো মেপে আয় বৃষ্টি ঝেঁপে।

তিনটের মধ্যে এটাই সবচেয়ে সরল, আর সম্ভবত সবচেয়ে প্রাচীন। 'আয় বৃষ্টি ঝেঁপে' হলো বৃষ্টি ডাকার মন্ত্র—বর্ষার প্রথম বৃষ্টির সময় বাংলার গ্রামেগঞ্জে আজও বাচ্চারা বাড়ির বাইরে ছুটোছুটি করে এই ছড়া কাটে। বাচ্চাটা বৃষ্টির কাছে ধানের বিনিময়ে জল চাইছে। বৃষ্টিকে এখানে সরাসরি সম্বোধন করা হচ্ছে, যেন সে এমন কেউ, যার সাথে রীতিমতো দরকষাকষি করা যায়।

ওই 'ঝেঁপে' শব্দটা খেয়াল করুন: এটা একটা ধ্বন্যাত্মক (onomatopoeic) শব্দ, ভারী বৃষ্টির আওয়াজ আর ওজনটাকে বোঝায়। এর কোনো পরিষ্কার সংস্কৃত ব্যুৎপত্তি নেই। এটা একটা নিরেট দেশি শব্দ—মাটি থেকে উঠে আসা ওই শব্দগুলোর মধ্যে একটা, যেগুলোর শেকড় ঠিক কোথা থেকে এসেছে, বাংলা ভাষা নিজেও তা হলফ করে বলতে পারে না। শব্দটার শুরুতে ওই 'ঝ-' দেখলেই আগের পর্বের কথা মনে পড়ে যায়: সেই ঝোল, ঝাল, ঝাড়, ঝিঙে—যেগুলো হয়তো মুন্ডা জনজাতির ভাষা থেকে ধার করা।

তবে এখানে শুধু শব্দটা আসল ব্যাপার নয়। আসল হলো *প্রথাটা*। বৃষ্টিকে আচার-অনুষ্ঠানের মাধ্যমে ডাকা, আবহাওয়া ভালো রাখার জন্য ফসলের ঘুষ দেওয়া, আর এই পুরো আচারে বাচ্চাদের পুরোহিতের মতো অংশগ্রহণ—এগুলো আসলে কৃষিভিত্তিক এক ধরণের তুষ্ট করার আচার (propitiation), যার সাথে মুন্ডা বা সাঁওতালদের ধর্মীয় রীতিনীতির প্রবল মিল রয়েছে। সাঁওতাল সম্প্রদায়ে বৃষ্টি ডাকার বিস্তারিত আচার রয়েছে: এই 'বৃষ্টি-ডাকা' একটা সামষ্টিক কাজ, যার দায়িত্বে থাকেন নির্দিষ্ট আচার-বিশেষজ্ঞরা, আর এতে গান, নৈবেদ্য এবং বিশেষ দেবতা বা শক্তির আবাহন জড়িয়ে থাকে।

বাচ্চাদের এই ছড়াটা হলো সেই আচারেরই একটা ধ্বংসাবশেষ—পলকা, খেলুড়ে, প্রেক্ষাপটবিহীন—যা এককালে একটা ভীষণ সিরিয়াস সামাজিক আচার ছিল। ভেতরের কথাটা রয়ে গেছে, কিন্তু প্রেক্ষাপটটা হারিয়ে গেছে। পড়ে আছে শুধু বাচ্চাদের একটা খেলা। ছড়ার মাধ্যমে বৃষ্টিকে ডাকার এই *প্রথাটা* নিশ্চিতভাবেই এই বাংলা ছড়াটার চেয়ে অনেক অনেক পুরনো। সম্ভবত প্রাক-ইন্দো-আর্য যুগের কৃষিভিত্তিক ধর্মীয় মন্ত্রের সাথে আমাদের সরাসরি যোগসূত্র হলো এই ছড়াটা।

### পুঁথি যখন নষ্ট হয়, ছড়া কেন টিকে থাকে?

একটু পিছিয়ে এসে এই টিকে থাকার কলকব্জাটার একটা নাম দেওয়া যাক, কারণ এটা দুনিয়াজোড়া সব সংস্কৃতিতেই দেখা যায় এবং এর একটা নাম থাকা উচিত।

যেখানে খোলা গদ্য বা পুঁথি হারিয়ে যায়, সেখানে নির্দিষ্ট ছন্দের মৌখিক রচনাগুলো দিব্যি টিকে থাকে। বাচ্চাদের ছড়ার ক্ষেত্রে এর পেছনে চারটে কারণ আছে:

**বাচ্চারা এটা শেখে বিচারবুদ্ধি তৈরি হওয়ার আগেই।** একটা বাচ্চা যখন 'আগডুম বাগডুম' শেখে, সে সেটা বিচার-বিশ্লেষণ করে শেখে না। সে বারবার আওড়াতে আওড়াতে, ছন্দের জাদুতে আর খেলার আনন্দে সেটা শুষে নেয়। যখন তার শব্দগুলোকে নিয়ে প্রশ্ন করার মতো বুদ্ধি হয়, তার অনেক আগেই শব্দগুলো তার মগজে গেঁথে গেছে, সাথে গেঁথে গেছে সেই ছন্দের রেশ।

**বোঝার চেয়ে আউড়ানোর জোর বেশি।** অনেক সময়ই মানেটা পুরোপুরি হারিয়ে যায়—বেশিরভাগ ক্ষেত্রেই যায়—কিন্তু শব্দের ধ্বনিটা ঠিক বেঁচে থাকে। আজকের দিনে বেশিরভাগ বাঙালি বাচ্চার কাছে 'আগডুম বাগডুম' কথাটার কোনো মানে নেই। অর্থটা হারিয়ে গেছে। কিন্তু আওয়াজটা রয়ে গেছে। ছন্দটা রয়ে গেছে। হাততালির তালটা রয়ে গেছে। প্রজন্ম থেকে প্রজন্মে এটা টিকে আছে কেউ এর মানে বোঝে বলে নয়, বরং এর *গঠনটা* বেশ মজাদার বলে।

**এগুলোর কোনো সামাজিক ছাপ বা লেবেল নেই।** কোনো ঔপনিবেশিক ম্যাজিস্ট্রেট বাচ্চাদের 'আগডুম বাগডুম' খেলতে দেখে প্রমাদ গোনেননি। কোনো সমাজসংস্কারক পণ্ডিত বাচ্চাদের বুলি নিয়ে চিন্তিত হননি। বড়দের কথার ওপর নজরদারি থাকলেও, বাচ্চাদের খেলাধুলা ক্ষমতার অলিন্দে একেবারেই অদৃশ্য। আর এই অদৃশ্য থাকাই হলো সবচেয়ে বড় সুরক্ষা।

**ছন্দটাই হলো বর্ম।** মাত্রাবৃত্ত বা ছন্দের কঠোর বাঁধন যেকোনো পরিবর্তনকে আটকে দেয়। যদি সিলেবল এদিক-ওদিক হয়, ছন্দ কেটে যায়; ছন্দ কাটলে, খেলাটা জমে না; আর খেলা না জমলে, বাচ্চা নিজেই ভুলটা শুধরে নেয়। এই সাঙ্গীতিক কাঠামোটা ভীষণ রক্ষণশীল। মানে হারিয়ে গেলেও ছন্দ ঠিক শব্দগুলোকে নিজের জায়গায় ধরে রাখে। ঠিক এই কারণেই যুগ যুগ ধরে মন্ত্র বা স্তোত্র টিকে থাকে: নির্দিষ্ট কাঠামো বিচ্যুতিকে বাধা দেয়। বাচ্চাদের খেলার ক্ষেত্রেও একই নিয়ম খাটে, কিন্তু এতে ধর্মগ্রন্থের মতো সেই গাম্ভীর্য থাকে না বলে কোনো সংস্কারক পণ্ডিত একে "উন্নত" করার চেষ্টাও করে না। আর এই কারণেই এটা ধর্মগ্রন্থের চেয়েও বেশি স্থিতিস্থাপক।

### মৈথিলী সংযোগ

এখানে সমান্তরাল একটা ঐতিহ্যের কথা একটু ছুঁয়ে যাই, যা প্রমাণ করে বাংলার এই 'ছড়া' ব্যাপারটা কোনো বিচ্ছিন্ন ঘটনা নয়, বরং পূর্ব ভারতের এক বৃহত্তর লোকজ-সাহিত্যের ইকোসিস্টেমের অংশ।

মৈথিলী—বর্তমান উত্তর বিহারের মিথিলা অঞ্চলের ভাষা—সেখানেও বাংলার মতোই এক অদ্ভুত সুন্দর লোককবিতার ধারা রয়েছে। বারোমাসি: এই কবিতা বা গানগুলো কৃষিকাজের ক্যালেন্ডার অনুযায়ী মাসে মাসে বদলাতে থাকে, বদলাতে থাকে কাজের ধরন, মানুষের আবেগ আর আবহাওয়া। এই বারোমাসি আপনি মৈথিলীতে পাবেন। বাংলায় পাবেন। আবার ওড়িয়াতেও পাবেন। এই গঠনশৈলীটা কোনো নির্দিষ্ট বাংলার পেটেন্ট নয়, এটা হলো পূর্ব ইন্দো-আর্য অঞ্চলের একটা ফর্ম—এমন এক কৃষিভিত্তিক সভ্যতার সাহিত্যিক প্রকাশ, যাদের জীবন চলে বর্ষার ক্যালেন্ডার ধরে।

মহান মৈথিলী কবি বিদ্যাপতি—যিনি চতুর্দশ ও পঞ্চদশ শতাব্দীতে লিখতেন—তিনি তাঁর মাতৃভাষা মৈথিলীতে যে পদাবলী রচনা করেছিলেন, তা আজ দুর্গাপূজার সময় বাংলার ঘরে ঘরে গাওয়া হয়। এই গানগুলো বাঙালির ভক্তি-আন্দোলনে এতটাই আষ্টেপৃষ্ঠে জড়িয়ে গেছে যে, যারা গাইছেন তাদের বেশিরভাগই জানেন না যে তারা বাংলা নয়, মৈথিলী গাইছেন। ভাষাগতভাবে ভাষা দুটো এতটাই কাছাকাছি—দুটোই মাগধী প্রাকৃত থেকে জন্মানো, দুটোই পূর্ব ইন্দো-আর্য পরিবারের—যে গানগুলো এক ভাষা থেকে অন্য ভাষায় প্রায় বিনা বাধায় চলে আসে।

এটাকে কিন্তু কোনোভাবেই 'কালচারাল অ্যাপ্রোপ্রিয়েশন' বা সাংস্কৃতিক দখলদারি বলা চলে না। এটা হলো একই শেকড় থেকে জন্মানো ভাষাগুলোর স্বাভাবিক আদান-প্রদান, যে ভাষাগুলো বলে এমন কিছু মানুষ, যাদের জলবায়ু এক, কৃষিব্যবস্থা এক এবং যাদের এক গভীর ঐতিহাসিক যোগ রয়েছে। এই পূর্ব ইন্দো-আর্য বলয়—বাংলা, অসমীয়া, মৈথিলী, মাগহী, ওড়িয়া—কখনোই আধুনিক রাষ্ট্রের মতো সিলমোহর মারা আলাদা আলাদা সংস্কৃতি ছিল না। এটা ছিল একটা বিস্তীর্ণ উপভাষার প্রবাহ, একটা যৌথ সাহিত্যিক ইকোসিস্টেম।

'আগডুম বাগডুম', 'খোকা ঘুমলো' বা 'আয় বৃষ্টি ঝেঁপে' এগুলো বাংলা, কারণ এগুলো বাংলায় মুখে মুখে ঘোরে। কিন্তু গভীর অর্থে এগুলো আসলে পূর্ব ভারতীয়—কারণ এদের ভেতরে লুকিয়ে থাকা স্মৃতি আর প্রকৃতির সাথে দরকষাকষির যে লজিক, তা ওই পুরো মালভূমির নিজস্ব সম্পদ।

### বয়ে চলেছি নদীর ন্যায়

খুব সাধারণ একটা কথা বলে শেষ করি।

পরের বার যখন কোনো বাচ্চার সাথে বসে 'আগডুম বাগডুম' বলে হাততালি দেবেন—বা নিজের ছোটবেলার কথা ভাববেন—একটু ভেবে দেখবেন তো, এই হাততালির মধ্যে দিয়ে আসলে কীসের হাতবদল হচ্ছে। আপনার হাতের চেটোর ওই তালটা হলো গড়ের মাঠের একটা অশ্বারোহী বাহিনীর ধ্বনিগত স্মৃতি, যাদের সামরিক পরিচয় ১৮৭১ সালে একটা আইনি নথিতে সই করে চিরতরে মুছে দেওয়া হয়েছিল। যে বাচ্চারা প্রথম এই খেলাটা খেলেছিল, তারা হয়তো জানত 'বাগডুম' মানে কী। তাদের নাতি-নাতনিরা একটু ধন্দে পড়েছিল। আর তাদেরও নাতি-নাতনিরা পুরো ব্যাপারটাই ভুলে গিয়েছিল। কিন্তু তালটা রয়ে গেল। ফর্মটা রয়ে গেল। খেলাটা টিকে রইল।

স্মৃতি বড় অদ্ভুত জিনিস। সে নিজেও সবসময় জানে না যে সে আসলে কিছু একটা মনে রাখছে। সে এমন অনেক পাত্রকে বয়ে নিয়ে চলে যেগুলোর ভেতরের আসল জিনিসটা কবেই খালি হয়ে গেছে—আর তারপর সেই খালি পাত্রগুলোকে ভরে দেয় নতুন কোনো অর্থে, বা সম্পূর্ণ অর্থহীনতায়, অথবা নিছক কিছু শব্দে।

কিন্তু যা বয়ে নিয়ে চলা হচ্ছে, তা ঠিকই রয়ে যায়। ওই হাততালিতে। ওই ঘুমপাড়ানি গানে। কিংবা ওই অ-সংস্কৃত শব্দের বৃষ্টি ডাকার ছড়াতে।

বাংলার সবচেয়ে বড় আর্কাইভ কোনো ব্রিটিশ লাইব্রেরিতে রাখা নেই। সেটা আছে আমাদের পাড়ার রোদ আর খেলার মাঠে।
