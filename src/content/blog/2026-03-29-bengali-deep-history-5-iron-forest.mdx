<div class="lang-en">

My grandmother's kitchen had a কামার (*kamar*, "blacksmith") knife — heavy, slightly asymmetric, the kind of thing that gets sharpened a thousand times until it's a different shape than it started. We called the person who sharpened it a *kamar* too, though by her time he was an itinerant who came through the neighbourhood twice a year rather than someone who lived in the village. The word was just there, embedded, like so many things in Bengali that turn out to have long histories when you pull on them.

I did not know, growing up, that *kamar* was a word with a shadow. That behind the Sanskrit surface — *karmāra*, "craftsman," from *karma*, "work" — there is a silence where another word used to be. A word spoken by people who had mastered iron before Sanskrit arrived in their hills. A word we no longer know.

## The Hills That Remembered Iron

This story does not begin in Bengal. It begins in Jharkhand — in the rugged, mineral-rich terrain of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, a highland region of dense sal forest, laterite rock, and iron ore deposits so close to the surface that in places you can see them rusting in the rain.

Sometime in the early first millennium BCE — possibly earlier, the dating is contested — someone on this plateau figured out how to smelt iron from ore. Not bronze, which requires rare tin, but iron, which is almost everywhere if you know how to find and process it. This is not a small thing. Iron changes everything: better ploughs, sharper axes, weapons that hold an edge. The civilization that mastered this technology in the eastern plateau is called, in local tradition and in archaeology, the Asura.

That name needs unpacking immediately, because the word *asura* in the Purāṇas and in popular Hinduism means "demon." This is the labeling process doing its work in real time. The earliest Vedic texts use *asura* to mean something closer to "powerful lord" or "mighty ruler." The eastern kingdoms of the Mahābhārata genealogy call their kings *asura*. Early Buddhist and Jain sources acknowledge that the peoples of the eastern seaboard spoke an "Asura-speech" that was fluent and poetic, described as flowing "like the current of the Ganga." These are human beings with language and culture, not demons.

The semantic slide from "powerful indigenous ruler" to "demon" tracks exactly with the process of Brahmanical state expansion eastward. The people who controlled the plateau and its iron — people who would not be easily absorbed into the varna system — became, in the texts produced by that expanding system, monsters. The archaeology tells us what they actually were.

## What S.C. Roy Found in Ranchi

In the early twentieth century, the Indian anthropologist Sarat Chandra Roy began documenting the Chota Nagpur Plateau systematically. What he found in the Ranchi district stopped him: over a hundred ancient sites that local Munda and other tribal communities unhesitatingly identified as *Asur garhs* (অসুর গড়, *asur garh*, "Asura forts") and *Asur sasans* (অসুর সাসান, *asur shasan*, "Asura cemeteries").

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="garh" bengali="গড়" meaning="fort, enclosure; appears in place names across eastern India as a marker of pre-Aryan fortified settlements" */}

These were not small or crude sites. Major excavations at Khuntitoli and Saradkel revealed the foundations of large baked-brick buildings — proper, fired brick, not mud — and massive water tanks. The settlements were positioned on elevated terrain near water sources, the classic signature of a community wealthy enough to need defense and organized enough to build lasting infrastructure.

The burial practice was meticulous. The Asuras cremated their dead, then placed the bones into large earthen urns. These urns were buried under massive stone slabs, each elevated on four corner stones so it resembled a small house. Covering a grave with such a slab required hauling multi-ton stones considerable distances. This is a community with organized labor, shared ritual, and the belief that the dead deserve substantial monuments.

The grave goods reveal how these people lived: bronze and copper chains, bracelets, ankle bells. Crystal and stone beads. Unstamped copper coins. One extraordinary find: a tiny metal figure of a man driving a plough pulled by two bullocks — a miniature scene of agricultural life rendered in cast metal, demonstrating advanced skills in lost-wax casting.

And everywhere, defining the landscape: iron slag. The remains of smelting furnaces. The ground around Asura sites in the Ranchi district is visibly marked by iron-working — millennia of metallurgical activity that stained the soil and piled up slag heaps that are still there. They worked two grades of iron, including a high-grade material described as "white iron," used for superior weaponry and durable tools.

Before any Sanskrit speaker had established state authority in these hills, the Asura civilization was smelting iron, building in brick, trading in copper, and burying their dead with ceremony. They were the technological leading edge of their region.

## The Munda Memory of Fire

The Munda oral tradition preserves the memory of how the Asura civilization ended. The myth involves Sing-bonga, the Munda supreme deity — a god of light and purity associated with the sun. In the tradition, the Asura ironworkers' massive furnaces filled the sky with smoke and heat, disturbing the natural order of the forest and angering Sing-bonga. The deity disguised himself, told the Asura men that if they entered their own furnaces they would find wealth inside. They did. They burned.

The surviving Asura women were then assimilated into Munda communities.

This myth is not subtle about what it encodes. It is a memory of territorial and technological conflict between two populations, told from the perspective of the victors, with the theological framing that the losers deserved what happened because their technology — the furnaces, the smoke — was itself transgressive. The Asura mastery of fire, the defining capability of their civilization, becomes in the Munda retelling the instrument of their destruction.

Archaeology supports the narrative of displacement and material appropriation. Roy and subsequent researchers documented instances where Munda communities literally dismantled Asura brick buildings to reuse the materials in their own constructions. The massive stone slabs from Asura grave markers were removed and repurposed. The subordinated people's monuments became raw material for the new inhabitants' own ceremony. This happened site by site, slab by slab.

## The Paradox at the Center

Here is the thing that has stayed with me since I first read this history.

Iron cleared the jungle.

The জঙ্গল (*jangal*, "forest, wilderness") — a word worth pausing on. Sanskrit has *jaṅgala*, but in Sanskrit it means dry, arid, barren land: almost the opposite of the dense forest the Bengali word names. The Bengali *jangal* meaning wilderness, the place you do not enter unprepared, may reflect a semantic shift in the substrate — the word's meaning drifting toward how non-Aryan speakers of the region understood it. This is contested; I note it as one possibility, not a certainty.

Whatever the word's origin, the forest it named was real: the dense sal and mixed forests of eastern India, the ecological basis of highland life, the territory that made independence possible for the people who knew how to live in it. Iron axes cut that forest. Iron-tipped ploughs turned the cleared land.

Plough agriculture requires a different social organization than forest-based mixed economies: you need to claim specific plots, defend them across seasons, pass them to children. Plough agriculture and property go together. Property and legal hierarchy go together. And the legal hierarchy of classical India was caste.

This is the paradox: the Asura civilization invented and mastered the technology — iron smelting — that eventually became the instrument of its own displacement. Their iron, used by the populations that absorbed and outlasted them, cleared the forests. The cleared forest became ploughed field. The ploughed field came under the authority of the caste system. The caste system required the Asura descendants — now the কামার (*kāmār*, "blacksmith") service caste — to remain in a subordinated position, producing tools for those who farmed the land that tools like theirs had opened.

The Munda people of the plateau acquired iron technology. They cleared more forest. The caste frontier advanced behind the iron axe. Hill communities found themselves in smaller and smaller refuge areas. The "scheduled tribe" geography of India today — the residual geography of tribal populations — is largely coextensive with terrain too steep, rocky, or remote to be profitably ploughed. The area the clearing process never reached, or found not worth taking.

Technology without political power is not protection. It is eventually appropriation.

## What the Word *Kāmār* Does Not Say

Sanskrit *karmāra* is a clear word with a clear derivation: *karma* (work, action) plus the agentive suffix *-āra*, producing "one who works," "craftsman." This became Bengali *kāmār*, the blacksmith caste.

This etymology is not disputed. I am not claiming that *kāmār* has a hidden substrate origin that archaeology reveals. The Sanskrit derivation is straightforward.

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="kāmār" bengali="কামার" meaning="blacksmith; from Sanskrit karmāra (karma + āra); the Indo-Aryan label applied after iron-working communities were incorporated into the varna system" */}

What the etymology does not tell you is what happened before the Sanskrit label arrived. The Asura ironworkers had a name for themselves. They had names for their craft, their furnaces, their grades of iron. We do not know any of those words. The Sanskrit label — *karmāra*, craftsman — replaced the indigenous self-description when iron-working communities were incorporated into the caste hierarchy as a service group. Their technology was retained. Their language of self-naming was not.

The word *asura* underwent the same process in reverse: it traveled from "powerful indigenous ruler" — the eastern kings of the Mahābhārata genealogy — to "demon" in the labeling that came with Brahmanical expansion. The people were demonized in the texts. Their specialists were incorporated as a service caste and relabeled in Sanskrit. The technology survived. The identity was overwritten on both ends.

What did the Asura call a blacksmith? We do not know. The furnaces are still in the ground in Ranchi district. The slag heaps are still visible. The descendants are still in the villages of Gumla. But the word is gone.

---

## The People Still There

The Asur community still exists. They live in small numbers in Jharkhand — in Gumla and Lohardaga districts — in villages where some households practice traditional iron-smelting using methods with direct continuity to the ancient furnace tradition that Roy documented.

The Government of India has classified them as a **Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group** (PVTG) — a designation created for communities whose population is declining or stagnant, who live in pre-agricultural or shifting-cultivation economies, who have low literacy, and who are at subsistence level.

The Forest Rights Act of 2006 and PESA 1996 (Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas Act) were both designed partly to address conditions like the Asur community's: to restore land rights to forest-dependent communities dispossessed through colonial and post-independence forest policy. These are Jharkhand laws as much as any Bengal concern. The eastern plateau — spanning what are now Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal — shares a legislative history and a dispossession history across the state border.

The Asura sites are in Ranchi district. The PVTG villages are in Gumla. S.C. Roy worked in colonial Bihar. This is a Jharkhand story. It connects to Bengali history through trade routes, through the iron that cleared the forests that eventually became the ploughed fields of the Bengal delta — but the people who started that process lived and live west of Bengal, on the plateau.

From master metallurgists — the civilization whose iron technology shaped the material culture of classical India — to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group in roughly three thousand years.

## The Silence in the Etymology

The *kāmār* in your grandmother's kitchen. The man who came twice a year to sharpen the knives, who carried his stone and his oil and his quiet skill from house to house. He had a caste title — *kāmār* — that is a Sanskrit word meaning craftsman, from the Sanskrit word for work. That is not his history. That is the label that replaced his history.

His history begins somewhere in the sal forests of Jharkhand, in a community that knew how to turn iron ore into tools before anyone in the Bengal delta had heard of the process. It runs through the furnaces that Roy found in Ranchi, through the slag heaps still rusting in the laterite rain, through the myth of Sing-bonga and the Asura men who went into the fire. It runs through the gradual clearing of the forest by the very tools that community made, the slow advance of the caste frontier that eventually incorporated the toolmakers as a subordinate service group and gave them a Sanskrit name.

The knife that belongs to your grandmother's kitchen traveled a long way to get there.

---

**Sources and confidence notes:** S.C. Roy's documentation of Asura sites in Ranchi district is foundational and reliable. The Sing-bonga myth is from Munda oral tradition. The Sanskrit derivation of *kāmār* from *karmāra* is uncontested. The claim that Asura descendants became the *kāmār* caste is a plausible historical inference, not a demonstrated genealogical fact. The *jangal* semantic shift (Sanskrit meaning dry/arid vs. Bengali meaning dense forest) is noted in scholarship but whether it reflects substrate influence is contested.

### যে পাহাড় লোহাকে মনে রেখেছিল

এই গল্পের শুরু কিন্তু বাংলায় নয়। শুরুটা ঝাড়খণ্ডে—ছোটনাগপুর মালভূমির সেই রুক্ষ, খনিজ সম্পদে ভরপুর এলাকায়। যেখানে শালবনের ঘন জঙ্গল, ল্যাটেরাইট পাথর আর লোহার আকরিক মাটির এত কাছাকাছি যে, কোথাও কোথাও বৃষ্টি পড়লে আকরিকের গায়ে জং ধরতে দেখা যায়।

খ্রিস্টপূর্ব প্রথম সহস্রাব্দের শুরুর দিকে—বা তারও আগে হতে পারে, সময়কাল নিয়ে পণ্ডিতদের মধ্যে বিস্তর তর্কবিতর্ক আছে—এই মালভূমির কোনো এক আদিবাসী আকরিক থেকে লোহা গলানোর কায়দাটা আয়ত্ত করে ফেলেছিল। ব্রোঞ্জ নয়, কারণ ব্রোঞ্জ বানাতে গেলে দুর্লভ টিনের দরকার হয়। লোহা কিন্তু প্রায় সর্বত্রই পাওয়া যায়, যদি আপনি জানেন কোথায় তাকে খুঁজতে হবে আর কীভাবে তাকে শোধন করতে হবে। এটা কিন্তু মোটেও চাট্টিখানি কথা নয়। লোহা সবকিছুর হিসেবনিকেশ বদলে দেয়: আরো ভালো লাঙল, আরও ধারালো কুড়ুল, এমন সব হাতিয়ার যার ধার সহজে মরে না। পূর্ব ভারতের মালভূমি অঞ্চলে যে সভ্যতা এই প্রযুক্তিটা প্রথম আয়ত্ত করেছিল, স্থানীয় লোককথা আর প্রত্নতত্ত্বের পরিভাষায় তাদের বলা হয় 'অসুর'।

এই নামটার একটু খোলসা করা দরকার, কারণ পুরাণ আর হিন্দু ধর্মে 'অসুর' মানে হলো 'দানব' বা 'দৈত্য'। ঠিক এখানেই কোনো একটা সম্প্রদায়কে তকমা পরানোর রাজনীতিটা কেমন নিখুঁতভাবে কাজ করে, তা বোঝা যায়। একদম আদি বৈদিক সাহিত্যগুলোতে 'অসুর' বলতে বোঝানো হতো 'ক্ষমতাশালী প্রভু' বা 'প্রতাপশালী শাসক'-এর মতো কিছু একটা। মহাভারতের বংশলতিকায় পূর্বদিকের রাজ্যগুলোর রাজাদের 'অসুর' বলা হয়েছে। প্রাচীন বৌদ্ধ আর জৈন গ্রন্থগুলোও স্বীকার করে যে, পূর্ব উপকূলের মানুষজন এক ধরনের 'অসুর-ভাষা'য় কথা বলত, যা ছিল রীতিমতো সাবলীল এবং কাব্যিক—যার বর্ণনা দেওয়া হয়েছে 'গঙ্গার স্রোতের মতো প্রবহমান' বলে। এরা ভাষা ও সংস্কৃতি সম্পন্ন জ্যান্ত মানুষ ছিল, কোনো দানব বা রাক্ষস নয়।

'ক্ষমতাশালী আদিবাসী শাসক' থেকে 'দানব'-এ এই যে অর্থের অবনমন, তা ব্রাহ্মণ্যবাদী রাষ্ট্রের পূর্বদিকে বিস্তারের সাথে একেবারে খাপে খাপে মিলে যায়। যে মানুষগুলোর হাতে মালভূমি আর তার লোহার নিয়ন্ত্রণ ছিল—যাদের সহজে বর্ণপ্রথার কাঠামোয় ঢোকানো যাচ্ছিল না—তারাই সেই আগ্রাসী ব্যবস্থার তৈরি করা পুঁথিপত্রে হয়ে উঠল রাক্ষস। অথচ প্রত্নতত্ত্ব আমাদের অন্য কথা বলে, তারা আসলে কী ছিল, তা চোখে আঙুল দিয়ে দেখিয়ে দেয়।

### শরৎচন্দ্র রায় রাঁচিতে কী পেয়েছিলেন

বিংশ শতাব্দীর শুরুর দিকে, ভারতীয় নৃবিজ্ঞানী শরৎচন্দ্র রায় ছোটনাগপুর মালভূমিতে রীতিমতো নিয়ম করে তথ্য সংগ্রহের কাজ শুরু করেন। রাঁচি জেলায় তিনি যা পেয়েছিলেন, তা তাঁকে চমকে দিয়েছিল: একশোরও বেশি প্রাচীন নিদর্শন, যেগুলোকে স্থানীয় মুন্ডা এবং অন্যান্য আদিবাসী সম্প্রদায় নির্দ্বিধায় অসুর গড় (*asur garh*) এবং অসুর সাসান (*asur shasan* বা 'অসুরদের গোরস্থান') বলে চিহ্নিত করেছিল।

এগুলো কোনো ছোটখাটো বা হেলাফেলা করার মতো জায়গা ছিল না। খুন্তিটোলি আর সারাদকেলে বড়সড় খননকাজের পর বিশাল আকারের পোড়া ইটের দালানের ভিত পাওয়া গেল—হ্যাঁ, রীতিমতো পোড়ানো ইট, কাদা-মাটির নয়—আর তার সাথে পেল্লায় সব জলাধার। জনবসতিগুলো তৈরি হয়েছিল জলের উৎসের কাছাকাছি, একটু উঁচুতে। এ হলো এমন এক সভ্যতার ধ্রুপদী চিহ্ন, যারা যথেষ্ট বিত্তবান ছিল বলেই সুরক্ষার প্রয়োজন বোধ করত এবং টেকসই কাঠামো বানানোর মতো সুসংগঠিতও ছিল।

তাদের শেষকৃত্যের পদ্ধতিও ছিল দেখার মতো নিখুঁত। অসুররা তাদের মৃতদেহ দাহ করত, তারপর হাড়গোড়গুলো বড় বড় মাটির পাত্রে ভরে রাখত। এই পাত্রগুলোকে তারা বিশাল পাথরের চাঁইয়ের নিচে পুঁতে রাখত। প্রতিটি চাঁইকে আবার চার কোণায় চারটে পাথর দিয়ে এমনভাবে উঁচু করে রাখা হতো, যাতে দেখতে একটা ছোট্ট ঘরের মতো লাগে। একটা কবরের ওপর এরকম একটা পাথরের আচ্ছাদন দিতে গেলে কয়েক টন ওজনের পাথর অনেকটা দূর থেকে বয়ে আনতে হয়। বোঝাই যায়, এই সম্প্রদায়ের মধ্যে সংগঠিত শ্রম, রীতিনীতি ভাগ করে নেওয়ার চল এবং মৃতেরা যে বড়সড় স্মৃতিস্তম্ভের দাবিদার—এই বিশ্বাসটা পাকাপোক্ত ছিল।

কবরের ভেতরের জিনিসপত্রগুলো দেখলে বোঝা যায় মানুষগুলো ঠিক কীভাবে বাঁচত: ব্রোঞ্জ আর তামার চেন, বালা, পায়ের ঘুঙুর। স্ফটিক আর পাথরের পুঁতি। ছাপ-না-মারা তামার মুদ্রা। একটা জিনিস তো রীতিমতো তাক লাগিয়ে দেওয়ার মতো: ধাতু দিয়ে তৈরি এক কৃষকের ছোট্ট মূর্তি, যে দুটো বলদ দিয়ে লাঙল চষছে। ছাঁচে-ঢালা ধাতুর তৈরি কৃষিজীবনের এক অপূর্ব মিনিয়েচার দৃশ্য, যা লস্ট-ওয়্যাক্স কাস্টিং (lost-wax casting) বা মোম-গলানো ছাঁচ-পদ্ধতিতে তাদের অসামান্য দক্ষতার প্রমাণ দেয়।

আর গোটা এলাকার পরতে পরতে ছড়িয়ে আছে যেটা: লোহার ধাতুমল বা স্ল্যাগ। লোহা গলানোর চুল্লির ধ্বংসাবশেষ। রাঁচি জেলায় অসুরদের সেই জায়গাগুলোর চারপাশে তাকালে লোহা-পেটানোর স্পষ্ট ছাপ চোখে পড়ে—হাজার হাজার বছরের ধাতুবিদ্যার চর্চা মাটির রঙ বদলে দিয়েছে, আর যে ধাতুমলের পাহাড় তারা তৈরি করেছিল, তা আজও সেখানে অম্লান। তারা দু'ধরনের লোহার কাজ করত, যার মধ্যে একটা ছিল উঁচু মানের 'সাদা লোহা', যা দিয়ে উন্নতমানের অস্ত্রশস্ত্র আর টেকসই হাতিয়ার বানানো হতো।

এই পাহাড়গুলোতে কোনো সংস্কৃতভাষী মানুষ নিজেদের রাজত্ব কায়েম করার বহু আগেই, অসুর সভ্যতা লোহা গলাচ্ছিল, ইটের ইমারত বানাচ্ছিল, তামার ব্যবসা করছিল আর রীতিমেনে মৃতদের সমাধি দিচ্ছিল। সেই যুগে, ওই অঞ্চলে তারাই ছিল প্রযুক্তিগতভাবে সবচেয়ে উন্নত সম্প্রদায়।

### মুন্ডাদের স্মৃতিতে আগুনের কথা

মুন্ডাদের মুখে মুখে ফেরা গল্পগুলোর মধ্যে অসুর সভ্যতার পতনের স্মৃতি আজও টিকে আছে। এই মিথ বা লোককথার কেন্দ্রে আছেন সিং-বোঙ্গা—মুন্ডাদের সর্বোচ্চ দেবতা, যিনি আলো আর পবিত্রতার প্রতীক এবং সূর্যের সাথে সম্পর্কিত। সেই লোককথা অনুযায়ী, অসুর কামারদের বিশালাকার চুল্লির ধোঁয়া আর তাপে গোটা আকাশ ভরে গিয়েছিল, যা জঙ্গলের স্বাভাবিক নিয়মকে ব্যাহত করে আর সিং-বোঙ্গাকে খেপিয়ে তোলে। দেবতা তখন ছদ্মবেশে এসে অসুর পুরুষদের বলেন, তারা যদি নিজেদের চুল্লির আগুনে প্রবেশ করে, তবে ভেতরে প্রচুর ধনসম্পদ পাবে। তারা তাই করল। আর আগুনে পুড়ে ছাই হলো।

বেঁচে যাওয়া অসুর মহিলাদের এরপর মুন্ডা সমাজে আত্মীকরণ করে নেওয়া হলো।

এই লোককথাটি কিন্তু তার ভেতরের আসল অর্থটা লুকোনোর কোনো চেষ্টাই করে না। এটা আসলে দুটো ভিন্ন জনগোষ্ঠীর মধ্যে এলাকা আর প্রযুক্তি নিয়ে সংঘাতের একটা জ্বলন্ত স্মৃতি। গল্পটা বিজয়ীদের দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি থেকে বলা, যেখানে একটা ধর্মীয় মোড়ক দেওয়া হয়েছে—পরাজিতদের সাথে যা হয়েছে তা তাদের প্রাপ্যই ছিল, কারণ তাদের প্রযুক্তি—সেই চুল্লি, সেই ধোঁয়া—ছিল প্রকৃতির নিয়মের পরিপন্থী। মুন্ডাদের এই আখ্যানে অসুরদের আগুন-বশ করার ক্ষমতা, যা তাদের সভ্যতার সবচেয়ে বড় বৈশিষ্ট্য ছিল, সেটাই হয়ে উঠল তাদের ধ্বংসের হাতিয়ার।

প্রত্নতত্ত্বও এই উচ্ছেদ আর সম্পদ দখলের আখ্যানকে সমর্থন করে। শরৎচন্দ্র রায় এবং তাঁর পরের গবেষকরা এমন বহু নিদর্শন লিপিবদ্ধ করেছেন, যেখানে মুন্ডা সম্প্রদায় রীতিমতো অসুরদের ইটের দালান ভেঙে সেই ইট নিজেদের কাজে লাগিয়েছে। অসুরদের কবরের সেই বিশাল পাথরের চাঁইগুলো সরিয়ে নিয়ে গিয়ে নিজেদের দরকারে ব্যবহার করেছে। বিজিত মানুষদের স্মৃতিস্তম্ভগুলোই নতুন বাসিন্দাদের আচার-অনুষ্ঠানের কাঁচামাল হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছিল। এটা একটা-দুটো জায়গায় নয়, একটার পর একটা সাইটে, একটার পর একটা পাথরের চাঁইয়ের ক্ষেত্রে ঘটেছে।

### মূল ধন্দটা কি?

**লোহাই জঙ্গল সাফ করেছিল।**

জঙ্গল (*jangal*)—শব্দটা নিয়ে একটু কুস্তি করতে হয়। সংস্কৃতে *jaṅgala* শব্দটা আছে ঠিকই, কিন্তু সেখানে এর অর্থ হলো শুকনো, ঊষর, অনুর্বর জমি: বাংলা শব্দটা যে ঘন অরণ্যকে বোঝায়, তার প্রায় উল্টো। বাংলায় 'জঙ্গল' মানে হলো বুনো জায়গা, যেখানে প্রস্তুতি ছাড়া ঢোকা যায় না। এর কারণ হয়তো স্থানীয় স্তরে অর্থের একটা পরিবর্তন—এই অঞ্চলের অনার্য ভাষাভাষী মানুষজন জঙ্গল বলতে যা বুঝত, শব্দটার অর্থ সেই দিকেই ঘুরে গিয়েছিল। পণ্ডিতদের মধ্যে এটা নিয়ে অবশ্য মতবিরোধ আছে; আমি এটাকে একটা সম্ভাবনা হিসেবেই ধরছি, ধ্রুবসত্য হিসেবে নয়।

শব্দের উৎপত্তি যাই হোক না কেন, সেটা যে অরণ্যের দিকে ইঙ্গিত করছিল তা এক্কেবারে বাস্তব: পূর্ব ভারতের সেই ঘন শাল আর মিশ্র অরণ্য, যা ছিল পাহাড়ের জীবনের পরিবেশগত ভিত্তি। এই জঙ্গলই সেই মানুষগুলোর স্বাধীনতার চাবিকাঠি ছিল, যারা এর ভেতর বেঁচে থাকার কায়দাটা জানত। লোহার কুড়ুল দিয়েই সেই জঙ্গল কাটা হয়েছিল। লোহার ফলা লাগানো লাঙল সেই সাফ করা জমি চষে ফেলেছিল।

জঙ্গল-নির্ভর মিশ্র অর্থনীতির চেয়ে লাঙল-ভিত্তিক কৃষিকাজে একদম অন্য ধরনের সমাজব্যবস্থার দরকার হয়: আপনাকে একটা নির্দিষ্ট জমির দখল নিতে হবে, ঋতু পরিবর্তনের সাথে সাথে তাকে রক্ষা করতে হবে, আর পরের প্রজন্মের হাতে তা তুলে দিতে হবে। লাঙল দিয়ে চাষ আর সম্পত্তির ধারণা—এই দুটো হাত ধরাধরি করে চলে। সম্পত্তি আর আইনি শ্রেণীবিন্যাস একসাথে চলে। আর ধ্রুপদী ভারতের সেই আইনি শ্রেণীবিন্যাসের নামই ছিল জাতপাত বা বর্ণপ্রথা।

এখানেই সেই চরম বৈপরীত্য বা প্যারাডক্স: অসুর সভ্যতাই লোহা গলানোর প্রযুক্তি আবিষ্কার করেছিল আর তাতে চূড়ান্ত দক্ষতা অর্জন করেছিল, যা কি না শেষমেশ তাদের নিজেদেরই উচ্ছেদের হাতিয়ার হয়ে দাঁড়াল। তাদের তৈরি লোহা দিয়ে চাষিরা জঙ্গল সাফ করল, ধীরে ধীরে তাদের গ্রাস করে নিলো। সাফ করা জঙ্গল হয়ে গেল চাষের জমি। আর চাষের জমির ওপর কায়েম হলো বর্ণপ্রথার অধিকার। সেই বর্ণপ্রথাই অসুরদের বংশধরদের—যাঁরা এখন কামার (*kāmār*) নামক সেবাদানকারী জাতি—এক অধস্তন জায়গায় আটকে রাখল। যে হাতিয়ার একদিন জঙ্গল কেটে চাষের জমি তৈরি করেছিল, সেই জমিতে যারা চাষাবাদ করত, তাদের জন্যই হাতিয়ার বানানোর কাজে এদের লাগিয়ে দেওয়া হলো।

মালভূমির মুন্ডারা লোহার প্রযুক্তি হস্তগত করল। তারা আরও জঙ্গল কাটল। লোহার কুড়ুলের পিছু পিছু জাতপাতের সীমানাও এগিয়ে চলল। পাহাড়ি সম্প্রদায়গুলো ক্রমশ আরও ছোট, আরও দুর্গম আশ্রয়স্থলে কোণঠাসা হয়ে পড়ল। আজকের ভারতে 'তফসিলি উপজাতি' বা শিডিউলড ট্রাইব-এর যে ভৌগোলিক মানচিত্র আমরা দেখি—অর্থাৎ উপজাতিদের বেঁচে থাকা শেষ জায়গাগুলো—তা মূলত সেইসব জমির সাথেই মিলে যায় যা এতই খাড়াই, রুক্ষ বা দুর্গম যে সেখানে লাঙল চালানো কোনো কাজের কথা নয়। জঙ্গল সাফ করার প্রক্রিয়া সেখানে পৌঁছতেই পারেনি, বা সেটাকে দখল করার যোগ্য বলে মনে করেনি।

রাজনৈতিক ক্ষমতা ছাড়া শুধু প্রযুক্তি কখনো রক্ষাকবচ হতে পারে না। শেষমেশ তা বেহাত হয়েই যায়।

### 'কামার' শব্দটা যা বলে না

সংস্কৃত *karmāra* শব্দটা এবং তার ব্যুৎপত্তি একেবারেই স্পষ্ট: *karma* (কর্ম বা কাজ) এবং তার সাথে কর্তা-বাচক প্রত্যয় *\-āra* (আর), সব মিলিয়ে 'যে কাজ করে' বা 'কারিগর'। এটাই বাংলায় এসে হলো 'কামার' (*kāmār*), অর্থাৎ কর্মকার জাতি।

এই ব্যুৎপত্তি নিয়ে কোনো বিতর্ক নেই। আমি এমন কোনো দাবি করছি না যে 'কামার' শব্দটার পিছনে কোনো লুকিয়ে থাকা অনার্য উৎস আছে, যা প্রত্নতত্ত্ব খুঁড়ে বের করেছে। সংস্কৃত ব্যুৎপত্তিটা এখানে একদম জলের মতো সোজা।

কিন্তু এই ব্যুৎপত্তি আপনাকে এটা বলে না যে, এই সংস্কৃত তকমাটা জুড়ে দেওয়ার আগে ঠিক কী ঘটেছিল। লোহা-গলানো অসুরদের নিশ্চয়ই নিজেদের একটা নাম ছিল। তাদের নিজেদের পেশার, চুল্লির, বা লোহার বিভিন্ন মান বোঝানোর নিজস্ব নাম ছিল। আমরা সেই শব্দগুলোর একটাও জানি না। যখন লোহা তৈরির কারিগর সম্প্রদায়কে সেবাদানকারী গোষ্ঠী হিসেবে জাতপাতের কাঠামোয় ঢুকিয়ে নেওয়া হলো, তখন তাদের আদিবাসী আত্মপরিচয়ের জায়গাটা দখল করে নিল এই সংস্কৃত তকমা—*karmāra* বা কারিগর। তাদের প্রযুক্তিটা শুধু রেখে দেওয়া হলো। আর মুছে ফেলা হলো তাদের নিজেদের দেওয়া নামগুলো।

'অসুর' শব্দটার ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক একই জিনিস ঘটেছিল, তবে উল্টো দিক থেকে। ব্রাহ্মণ্যবাদী বিস্তারের তকমা-পরানোর খেলায় শব্দটা 'ক্ষমতাশালী আদিবাসী শাসক'—মহাভারতের বংশলতিকার সেই পূর্বদিককার রাজা—থেকে সোজা 'দানব'-এ এসে ঠেকল। পুঁথিপত্রে এই মানুষগুলোকে দানব বলে দাগিয়ে দেওয়া হলো। আর তাদের কারিগরদের সেবাদানকারী জাতি হিসেবে আত্মসাৎ করে সংস্কৃত নাম দেওয়া হলো। প্রযুক্তিটা দিব্যি টিকে গেল। কিন্তু দু'দিক থেকেই তাদের নিজস্ব পরিচিতি মুছে দেওয়া হলো।

অসুররা কামারকে কী বলত? আমরা জানি না। রাঁচি জেলার মাটিতে আজও সেই চুল্লিগুলো লুকিয়ে আছে। ধাতুমলের সেই পাহাড় আজও দৃশ্যমান। তাদের বংশধরেরা আজও গুমলা জেলার গাঁয়ে গাঁয়ে বেঁচে আছে। কিন্তু শব্দটা হারিয়ে গেছে চিরতরে।

### যে মানুষগুলো আজও সেখানে রয়ে গেছে

অসুর সম্প্রদায় কিন্তু আজও টিকে আছে। ঝাড়খণ্ডে—গুমলা আর লোহারদাগা জেলায়—অল্প সংখ্যায় তাদের দেখা মেলে। এমন কিছু গ্রাম আছে, যেখানে আজও কয়েকটি পরিবার সেই প্রাচীন পদ্ধতিতে লোহা গলানোর কাজ করে, যা শরৎচন্দ্র রায়-এর নথিবদ্ধ করা সেই আদি চুল্লির ঐতিহ্যের সরাসরি ধারাবাহিকতা বহন করে চলেছে।

ভারত সরকার তাদের **পার্টিকুলারলি ভালনারেবল ট্রাইবাল গ্রুপ** (PVTG) বা বিশেষভাবে দুর্বল উপজাতি গোষ্ঠী হিসেবে চিহ্নিত করেছে। এই তকমাটা সেইসব সম্প্রদায়ের জন্যই বানানো, যাদের জনসংখ্যা কমছে বা স্থবির হয়ে আছে, যারা এখনও প্রাক-কৃষি বা স্থানান্তর-কৃষি অর্থনীতির উপর নির্ভরশীল, যাদের শিক্ষার হার তলানিতে, আর যারা কোনোমতে জীবনধারণ করছে।

২০০৬ সালের অরণ্য অধিকার আইন এবং ১৯৯৬ সালের পেসা (PESA - Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas Act) আইন—দুটোই কিছুটা হলেও অসুরদের মতো সম্প্রদায়ের অবস্থার কথা ভেবেই তৈরি হয়েছিল: ঔপনিবেশিক যুগে এবং স্বাধীনতার পর বননীতির জাঁতাকলে পড়ে যে জঙ্গল-নির্ভর সম্প্রদায়গুলো তাদের জমি হারিয়েছিল, তাদের অধিকার ফিরিয়ে দেওয়ার জন্যই এই আইন। এগুলো বাংলার মতোই ঝাড়খণ্ডেরও আইন। পূর্ব ভারতের মালভূমি—যা এখন ঝাড়খণ্ড, ওড়িশা আর পশ্চিমবঙ্গের মধ্যে ছড়িয়ে আছে—রাষ্ট্রীয় সীমানা ছাড়িয়ে তাদের একটা আইনি ইতিহাস এবং জমি থেকে উৎখাত হওয়ার এক অভিন্ন ইতিহাস রয়েছে।

অসুরদের সেই প্রত্নক্ষেত্রগুলো রাঁচি জেলায়। পিভিটিজি (PVTG) গ্রামগুলো গুমলায়। শরৎচন্দ্র রায় কাজ করেছিলেন ঔপনিবেশিক বিহারে। এটা আসলে ঝাড়খণ্ডেরই গল্প। কিন্তু বাণিজ্যের পথ ধরে এটা বাংলার ইতিহাসের সাথেও জুড়ে যায়। যে লোহা দিয়ে জঙ্গল সাফ করে একদিন বদ্বীপ বাংলায় লাঙল-চষা জমির বিস্তার ঘটেছিল, সেই লোহাই এই সেতুবন্ধন করেছিল। তবে এই প্রক্রিয়ার যারা সূত্রপাত করেছিল, তারা বাংলার পশ্চিমে, ওই মালভূমিতেই বাস করত, আর আজও করে।

ধাতুবিদ্যার মহারথী—যাদের লোহার প্রযুক্তি ধ্রুপদী ভারতের বস্তুগত সংস্কৃতির রূপরেখা তৈরি করে দিয়েছিল—প্রায় তিন হাজার বছরের ব্যবধানে তারাই আজ বিশেষভাবে দুর্বল এক উপজাতি গোষ্ঠী!

### ব্যুৎপত্তির গভীরে লুকিয়ে থাকা নিস্তব্ধতা

হেঁশেলের সেই কামার (*kāmār*)। সেই লোকটা, যে বছরে দু'বার ছুরি-বঁটিতে শান দিতে আসত, যে তার শানপাথর, তেল আর নিস্তব্ধ দক্ষতাটুকু পুঁটুলিতে বেঁধে বাড়ি বাড়ি ঘুরে বেড়াত। তার একটা জাত-উপাধি ছিল—'কামার'—যা কিনা একটা সংস্কৃত শব্দ, সংস্কৃত 'কর্ম' শব্দ থেকে যার উৎপত্তি, অর্থ কারিগর। কিন্তু ওটা তার ইতিহাস নয়। ওটা হলো একটা তকমা, যা তার আসল ইতিহাসটাকে প্রতিস্থাপন করেছে মাত্র।

তার ইতিহাসের শুরুটা ঝাড়খণ্ডের শালবনের কোথাও। এমন একটা সম্প্রদায়ের মধ্যে, যারা বদ্বীপ বাংলার কেউ লোহার কথা কানে শোনার বহু আগেই আকরিক লোহা থেকে হাতিয়ার বানানোর কায়দাটা শিখে ফেলেছিল। সেই ইতিহাস বয়ে চলে রাঁচিতে শরৎচন্দ্র রায়ের খুঁজে পাওয়া সেই চুল্লিগুলোর মধ্যে দিয়ে, ল্যাটেরাইটের বৃষ্টিতে আজও জং ধরতে থাকা ধাতুমলের পাহাড়ের মধ্যে দিয়ে, সিং-বোঙ্গার মিথ আর আগুনে ঝাঁপ দেওয়া অসুর পুরুষদের মধ্যে দিয়ে। সেই ইতিহাস জড়িয়ে আছে ওই সম্প্রদায়েরই বানানো হাতিয়ার দিয়ে ধীরে ধীরে জঙ্গল সাফ হওয়ার গল্পে, বর্ণপ্রথার সীমানা ক্রমশ এগিয়ে এসে একদিন ওই হাতিয়ার-নির্মাতাদেরই একটা অধস্তন সেবাদানকারী গোষ্ঠীতে পরিণত করার এবং তাদের একটা সংস্কৃত নাম ধরিয়ে দেওয়ার গল্পে।

আপনার দিদিমার হেঁশেলে যে ছুরিটা রাজত্ব করত, সেখানে পৌঁছতে তাকে সত্যিই অনেকটা পথ পেরোতে হয়েছিল।

**সূত্র:** রাঁচি জেলায় অসুর প্রত্নক্ষেত্রগুলো নিয়ে S.C. Roy-এর নথিভুক্তকরণ একদম মৌলিক এবং নির্ভরযোগ্য। সিং-বোঙ্গার মিথটি মুন্ডাদের লোককথা থেকে নেওয়া। *karmāra* থেকে *kāmār* শব্দের সংস্কৃত ব্যুৎপত্তি নিয়ে কোনো বিতর্ক নেই। অসুরদের বংশধরেরাই যে পরবর্তীকালে *kāmār* জাতিতে পরিণত হয়েছিল, এই দাবিটা ঐতিহাসিকভাবে যুক্তিসঙ্গত একটি অনুমান মাত্র, কোনো প্রমাণিত বংশানুক্রমিক সত্য নয়। *jangal* শব্দের অর্থের এই বাঁকবদল (সংস্কৃতে শুকনো/ঊষর বনাম বাংলায় ঘন অরণ্য) গবেষণাপত্রে উল্লেখিত হলেও, এটা অনার্য বা সাবস্ট্রেট ভাষার প্রভাব কি না, তা নিয়ে পণ্ডিতদের মধ্যে মতভেদ রয়েছে।
