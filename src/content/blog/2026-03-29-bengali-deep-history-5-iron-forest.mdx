My grandmother's kitchen had a কামার (*kamar*, "blacksmith") knife — heavy, slightly asymmetric, the kind of thing that gets sharpened a thousand times until it's a different shape than it started. We called the person who sharpened it a *kamar* too, though by her time he was an itinerant who came through the neighbourhood twice a year rather than someone who lived in the village. The word was just there, embedded, like so many things in Bengali that turn out to have long histories when you pull on them.

I did not know, growing up, that *kamar* was a word with a shadow. That behind the Sanskrit surface — *karmāra*, "craftsman," from *karma*, "work" — there is a silence where another word used to be. A word spoken by people who had mastered iron before Sanskrit arrived in their hills. A word we no longer know.

## The Hills That Remembered Iron

This story does not begin in Bengal. It begins in Jharkhand — in the rugged, mineral-rich terrain of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, a highland region of dense sal forest, laterite rock, and iron ore deposits so close to the surface that in places you can see them rusting in the rain.

Sometime in the early first millennium BCE — possibly earlier, the dating is contested — someone on this plateau figured out how to smelt iron from ore. Not bronze, which requires rare tin, but iron, which is almost everywhere if you know how to find and process it. This is not a small thing. Iron changes everything: better ploughs, sharper axes, weapons that hold an edge. The civilization that mastered this technology in the eastern plateau is called, in local tradition and in archaeology, the Asura.

That name needs unpacking immediately, because the word *asura* in the Purāṇas and in popular Hinduism means "demon." This is the labeling process doing its work in real time. The earliest Vedic texts use *asura* to mean something closer to "powerful lord" or "mighty ruler." The eastern kingdoms of the Mahābhārata genealogy call their kings *asura*. Early Buddhist and Jain sources acknowledge that the peoples of the eastern seaboard spoke an "Asura-speech" that was fluent and poetic, described as flowing "like the current of the Ganga." These are human beings with language and culture, not demons.

The semantic slide from "powerful indigenous ruler" to "demon" tracks exactly with the process of Brahmanical state expansion eastward. The people who controlled the plateau and its iron — people who would not be easily absorbed into the varna system — became, in the texts produced by that expanding system, monsters. The archaeology tells us what they actually were.

## What S.C. Roy Found in Ranchi

In the early twentieth century, the Indian anthropologist Sarat Chandra Roy began documenting the Chota Nagpur Plateau systematically. What he found in the Ranchi district stopped him: over a hundred ancient sites that local Munda and other tribal communities unhesitatingly identified as *Asur garhs* (অসুর গড়, *asur garh*, "Asura forts") and *Asur sasans* (অসুর সাসান, *asur shasan*, "Asura cemeteries").

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="garh" bengali="গড়" meaning="fort, enclosure; appears in place names across eastern India as a marker of pre-Aryan fortified settlements" */}

These were not small or crude sites. Major excavations at Khuntitoli and Saradkel revealed the foundations of large baked-brick buildings — proper, fired brick, not mud — and massive water tanks. The settlements were positioned on elevated terrain near water sources, the classic signature of a community wealthy enough to need defense and organized enough to build lasting infrastructure.

The burial practice was meticulous. The Asuras cremated their dead, then placed the bones into large earthen urns. These urns were buried under massive stone slabs, each elevated on four corner stones so it resembled a small house. Covering a grave with such a slab required hauling multi-ton stones considerable distances. This is a community with organized labor, shared ritual, and the belief that the dead deserve substantial monuments.

The grave goods reveal how these people lived: bronze and copper chains, bracelets, ankle bells. Crystal and stone beads. Unstamped copper coins. One extraordinary find: a tiny metal figure of a man driving a plough pulled by two bullocks — a miniature scene of agricultural life rendered in cast metal, demonstrating advanced skills in lost-wax casting.

And everywhere, defining the landscape: iron slag. The remains of smelting furnaces. The ground around Asura sites in the Ranchi district is visibly marked by iron-working — millennia of metallurgical activity that stained the soil and piled up slag heaps that are still there. They worked two grades of iron, including a high-grade material described as "white iron," used for superior weaponry and durable tools.

Before any Sanskrit speaker had established state authority in these hills, the Asura civilization was smelting iron, building in brick, trading in copper, and burying their dead with ceremony. They were the technological leading edge of their region.

## The Munda Memory of Fire

The Munda oral tradition preserves the memory of how the Asura civilization ended. The myth involves Sing-bonga, the Munda supreme deity — a god of light and purity associated with the sun. In the tradition, the Asura ironworkers' massive furnaces filled the sky with smoke and heat, disturbing the natural order of the forest and angering Sing-bonga. The deity disguised himself, told the Asura men that if they entered their own furnaces they would find wealth inside. They did. They burned.

The surviving Asura women were then assimilated into Munda communities.

This myth is not subtle about what it encodes. It is a memory of territorial and technological conflict between two populations, told from the perspective of the victors, with the theological framing that the losers deserved what happened because their technology — the furnaces, the smoke — was itself transgressive. The Asura mastery of fire, the defining capability of their civilization, becomes in the Munda retelling the instrument of their destruction.

Archaeology supports the narrative of displacement and material appropriation. Roy and subsequent researchers documented instances where Munda communities literally dismantled Asura brick buildings to reuse the materials in their own constructions. The massive stone slabs from Asura grave markers were removed and repurposed. The subordinated people's monuments became raw material for the new inhabitants' own ceremony. This happened site by site, slab by slab.

## The Paradox at the Center

Here is the thing that has stayed with me since I first read this history.

Iron cleared the jungle.

The জঙ্গল (*jangal*, "forest, wilderness") — a word worth pausing on. Sanskrit has *jaṅgala*, but in Sanskrit it means dry, arid, barren land: almost the opposite of the dense forest the Bengali word names. The Bengali *jangal* meaning wilderness, the place you do not enter unprepared, may reflect a semantic shift in the substrate — the word's meaning drifting toward how non-Aryan speakers of the region understood it. This is contested; I note it as one possibility, not a certainty.

Whatever the word's origin, the forest it named was real: the dense sal and mixed forests of eastern India, the ecological basis of highland life, the territory that made independence possible for the people who knew how to live in it. Iron axes cut that forest. Iron-tipped ploughs turned the cleared land.

Plough agriculture requires a different social organization than forest-based mixed economies: you need to claim specific plots, defend them across seasons, pass them to children. Plough agriculture and property go together. Property and legal hierarchy go together. And the legal hierarchy of classical India was caste.

This is the paradox: the Asura civilization invented and mastered the technology — iron smelting — that eventually became the instrument of its own displacement. Their iron, used by the populations that absorbed and outlasted them, cleared the forests. The cleared forest became ploughed field. The ploughed field came under the authority of the caste system. The caste system required the Asura descendants — now the কামার (*kāmār*, "blacksmith") service caste — to remain in a subordinated position, producing tools for those who farmed the land that tools like theirs had opened.

The Munda people of the plateau acquired iron technology. They cleared more forest. The caste frontier advanced behind the iron axe. Hill communities found themselves in smaller and smaller refuge areas. The "scheduled tribe" geography of India today — the residual geography of tribal populations — is largely coextensive with terrain too steep, rocky, or remote to be profitably ploughed. The area the clearing process never reached, or found not worth taking.

Technology without political power is not protection. It is eventually appropriation.

## What the Word *Kāmār* Does Not Say

Sanskrit *karmāra* is a clear word with a clear derivation: *karma* (work, action) plus the agentive suffix *-āra*, producing "one who works," "craftsman." This became Bengali *kāmār*, the blacksmith caste.

This etymology is not disputed. I am not claiming that *kāmār* has a hidden substrate origin that archaeology reveals. The Sanskrit derivation is straightforward.

{/* CognateTooltip: latin="kāmār" bengali="কামার" meaning="blacksmith; from Sanskrit karmāra (karma + āra); the Indo-Aryan label applied after iron-working communities were incorporated into the varna system" */}

What the etymology does not tell you is what happened before the Sanskrit label arrived. The Asura ironworkers had a name for themselves. They had names for their craft, their furnaces, their grades of iron. We do not know any of those words. The Sanskrit label — *karmāra*, craftsman — replaced the indigenous self-description when iron-working communities were incorporated into the caste hierarchy as a service group. Their technology was retained. Their language of self-naming was not.

The word *asura* underwent the same process in reverse: it traveled from "powerful indigenous ruler" — the eastern kings of the Mahābhārata genealogy — to "demon" in the labeling that came with Brahmanical expansion. The people were demonized in the texts. Their specialists were incorporated as a service caste and relabeled in Sanskrit. The technology survived. The identity was overwritten on both ends.

What did the Asura call a blacksmith? We do not know. The furnaces are still in the ground in Ranchi district. The slag heaps are still visible. The descendants are still in the villages of Gumla. But the word is gone.

---

## The People Still There

The Asur community still exists. They live in small numbers in Jharkhand — in Gumla and Lohardaga districts — in villages where some households practice traditional iron-smelting using methods with direct continuity to the ancient furnace tradition that Roy documented.

The Government of India has classified them as a **Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group** (PVTG) — a designation created for communities whose population is declining or stagnant, who live in pre-agricultural or shifting-cultivation economies, who have low literacy, and who are at subsistence level.

The Forest Rights Act of 2006 and PESA 1996 (Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas Act) were both designed partly to address conditions like the Asur community's: to restore land rights to forest-dependent communities dispossessed through colonial and post-independence forest policy. These are Jharkhand laws as much as any Bengal concern. The eastern plateau — spanning what are now Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal — shares a legislative history and a dispossession history across the state border.

The Asura sites are in Ranchi district. The PVTG villages are in Gumla. S.C. Roy worked in colonial Bihar. This is a Jharkhand story. It connects to Bengali history through trade routes, through the iron that cleared the forests that eventually became the ploughed fields of the Bengal delta — but the people who started that process lived and live west of Bengal, on the plateau.

From master metallurgists — the civilization whose iron technology shaped the material culture of classical India — to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group in roughly three thousand years.

## The Silence in the Etymology

The *kāmār* in your grandmother's kitchen. The man who came twice a year to sharpen the knives, who carried his stone and his oil and his quiet skill from house to house. He had a caste title — *kāmār* — that is a Sanskrit word meaning craftsman, from the Sanskrit word for work. That is not his history. That is the label that replaced his history.

His history begins somewhere in the sal forests of Jharkhand, in a community that knew how to turn iron ore into tools before anyone in the Bengal delta had heard of the process. It runs through the furnaces that Roy found in Ranchi, through the slag heaps still rusting in the laterite rain, through the myth of Sing-bonga and the Asura men who went into the fire. It runs through the gradual clearing of the forest by the very tools that community made, the slow advance of the caste frontier that eventually incorporated the toolmakers as a subordinate service group and gave them a Sanskrit name.

The knife that belongs to your grandmother's kitchen traveled a long way to get there.
