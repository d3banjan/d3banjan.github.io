<div class="lang-en">

There is a dish that Bengalis eat at home that I cannot translate.

মাছের টক ঝোল (*maacher tok jhol*, "fish in sour thin broth") — the name itself dissolves into something pre-linguistic when I try to explain it to someone who did not grow up eating it. Not a curry, which implies thickness and richness. Not a soup, which implies Europe and a spoon held the wrong way.

A *jhol* is thin. Almost clear. A little turmeric, a little chili — cumin tempering for rohu or katla, mustard tempering for pabda or hilsa. Sour if it's a *tok jhol*: the sourness from tamarind or raw mango or sometimes just the sharpness of mustard oil. The fish — always freshwater, always a little bony — barely holds together in it. And underneath everything, in east Bengal, there is a fermented dried-fish paste called শিদল (*shidal*) that functions the way fish sauce functions in Vietnamese cooking: invisible, essential, unremarkable to those who grew up with it.

I mention *maacher tok jhol* because it is where this whole series starts for me. Not with grammar or cognates or scholarly apparatus, but with a bowl of something that has no Indo-Aryan explanation. What strikes me is the structural resemblance to things I have eaten elsewhere in Southeast Asia — the sour-thin-fish logic that appears in Vietnamese *canh chua*, or the rice-noodle broth of Burmese *mohinga* with its *ngapi* fermented-fish paste doing exactly what *shidal* does. I cannot prove these are related. But the pattern is notable enough to sit with.

Living in Berlin, when north Indian restaurants no longer satisfy, I find myself reaching for tom yum soup — the closest approximation available. The same thin-sour logic, the same fish-forward transparency. Only the souring agent differs: lemongrass and lime instead of raw mango.

The thin-sour-fish food tradition is not an adaptation of anything that came from the northwest, from Sanskrit-speaking priests, from the plains of the Gangetic heartland. It is older than Bengali. It predates every text we have. And শিদল (*shidal*) never once appears in a Brahminical cooking manual. Because it was not their food. It was the food of the people who were here before their words arrived.

The deepest layers of Bengali culture are not where we usually look for them. They are in the kitchen. They are in the body. They are in the words that feel the most Bengali — which are, as I will argue, probably the *oldest* non-Bengali words in the language.

---

## The Comfort Words

Let me give you an inventory. These are words I grew up with, words that feel bone-deep, words I did not learn so much as absorb:

<CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" /> (*dheki*, "rice-husking lever") — the tall wooden contraption, worked by foot, that women used every morning to pound rice in villages. I was a townie — but I did grow up with the proverb: *ঢেঁকি স্বর্গে গেলেও ধান ভানে* (*dheki shorge geleo dhaan bhaane*, "even if the rice-husking lever goes to heaven, it pounds paddy there"). Some things do not stop being what they are.

পটল (*potol*, "pointed gourd") — a vegetable so Bengali it barely exists anywhere else. Try explaining it to someone from Delhi. (Sanskrit *paṭola* exists in Ayurvedic texts, so *potol* may be a tadbhava form rather than a deshi word; I include it for its cultural feel, not its etymological opacity.)

<CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" /> (*jhinge*, "ridge gourd") — another one. You can gesture at it. You cannot translate the way it tastes on a Tuesday.

<CognateTooltip latin="danga" bengali="ডাঙা" meaning="highland, raised ground above flood line" /> (*danga*, "highland, raised ground above the flood line") — we used to play *কুমির-ডাঙা* (*kumir-danga*, "crocodile-land") in the schoolyard: one child is the *kumir* (crocodile, "it"), and everyone else is safe only on *danga* (raised ground, any elevated surface). The whole hydrological anxiety of Bengal — floods, crocodiles, the treacherous lowland — compressed into a children's game.

<CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" /> (*hari*, "earthen pot") — the vessel for cooking, for carrying water, for storing grain. The most domestic object in the Bengali universe has this name.

And then the onomatopoeia, which is its own world. Bengali has an astonishing number of words that are pure sound mimicry:

ঝমঝম (*jhomjhom*) — the sound of heavy monsoon rain on a tin roof.

টিপটিপ (*tip tip*) — the sound of gentle drizzle, almost apologetic.

গুড়গুড় (*gurgur*) — the low rumble of distant thunder.

These are not words you find in Sanskrit dictionaries. These are not words that Indo-Aryan etymology explains. They feel *irreducibly Bengali* — impossible to trace, impossible to fully translate, inexplicable to a Hindi speaker who encounters them for the first time.

I sometimes wonder if this is why Bengali doctors are such valuable exports to the Western world. The language has an extraordinary vocabulary for differentiating kinds of discomfort — every gradation of pain, fatigue, and minor suffering has its own precise word. That granularity shapes how a doctor listens. A quantitative and qualitative empathy for pain, if you will, built into the mother tongue.

And that, it turns out, is exactly the clue.

---

## The Provocation

Here is the argument I want to make in this first post, because it reframes everything that follows in this series:

**The words that feel most Bengali are probably the oldest non-Bengali words in the language.**

The comfort words, the kitchen words, the words for topography and tools and rain — these are the residue. They are what survives when a language is replaced but a people are not. They are the ghost vocabulary of populations who lived in Bengal for thousands of years before any Indo-Aryan speaker arrived, whose languages were gradually displaced and then swallowed whole, but whose words — the ones used every morning in the kitchen, at the <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" />, at the ঢাক and ঢোল (*dhak* and *dhol*, the festival drums), in the fields, in the rain — refused to leave.

To understand why this happens, you need to understand something about how vocabulary works under language contact. Technical terms from prestige domains — religion, law, philosophy, astronomy — get replaced fast. The elites adopt the new language's terms, and the old words disappear within a generation or two. But kitchen vocabulary is different. Kitchen vocabulary is transmitted from the older cook to their younger family members in the middle of cooking, not in classrooms or temples. The word for the earthen pot is what you say when you tell a child to pick it up. It is not taught; it is demonstrated. Prestige vocabulary lives in texts. Kitchen vocabulary lives in bodies.

The Sanskrit word for the rice-husking apparatus is *ulūkhala* (for the mortar) and *musala* (for the pestle). These words survived — in texts, in Sanskrit dictionaries, in Brahminical ritual contexts. But every Bengali villager who pounded rice every morning called the whole contraption a <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" />. And *dheki* is not Sanskrit. It has no Sanskrit etymology. It is, in the best current assessment of historical linguistics, a word inherited from the Austroasiatic-speaking peoples who were in Bengal before the Indo-Aryan languages arrived — peoples who spoke languages related to modern Munda languages like Santali, Mundari, and Ho, which survive today in the highlands of Jharkhand and western Odisha, spoken by communities who call themselves the original inhabitants of the land. They have oral traditions that say so. Genetic studies — particularly work by David Reich's lab on ancient South Asian population history and Paul Sidwell's 2018 synthesis on Austroasiatic origins — are beginning to corroborate the broad outline: a male-biased migration of Austroasiatic speakers into eastern India, arriving from the east, roughly 4,000 years ago.

## The Vocabulary Breakdown

The linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji published his monumental *Origin and Development of the Bengali Language* (abbreviated ODBL) in 1926 — still the foundational scholarly work on Bengali historical linguistics. His count of the Bengali lexicon produced a figure that is worth sitting with:

Approximately **44%** of Bengali vocabulary is *tatsama* — তৎসম (*tôtsôm*, "same as that") — words taken directly from Sanskrit with minimal alteration. *Dharma*. *Karma*. বৃক্ষ (*briksha*, "tree"). These are the prestige loans, the Brahminical layer, the words that came with the priests and the texts.

The remaining **roughly 56%** falls into two other categories: *tadbhava* — তদ্ভব (*tôdbhôb*, "derived from that") — words that *started* in Sanskrit or Prakrit but have been modified beyond clean recognition — and *deshi* — দেশী (*deşi*, "of the land") — words of unknown or non-Aryan origin that simply exist in Bengali without any Sanskrit explanation.

That *deshi* category is where the comfort words live. <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" />. <CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" />. <CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" />. <CognateTooltip latin="danga" bengali="ডাঙা" meaning="highland, raised ground" />. The words your grandmother used every day.

## The Munda Layer

Linguists use the term "substrate" for the vocabulary, sounds, and grammatical features that survive in a language from an *earlier* language that was displaced. Bengali has a substantial Austroasiatic substrate, specifically from Munda languages, and a secondary substrate from Tibeto-Burman languages (the Bodo/Koch family) in the north and northeast of the region.

"Austroasiatic" is a language family that today includes the Munda languages of eastern India (Santali, Mundari, Ho) and the Mon-Khmer languages of Southeast Asia (Vietnamese, Khmer, Mon). The name signals the hypothesis that these languages once occupied a much larger territory stretching from India through Southeast Asia, before being displaced by later migrations. The Munda speakers of Jharkhand and Odisha are their westernmost living remnant in South Asia.

One structural feature worth noting: both Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman languages lack grammatical gender entirely. And the eastern Indian languages born from Magadhi Prakrit — Bengali, Assamese, Odia, Bhojpuri — all shed grammatical gender too, in stark contrast to Hindi and the western Indo-Aryan languages. Whether this is substrate influence or coincidence is debated, but the pattern runs deep.

<SVGMap
  title="Austroasiatic languages: the substrate beneath Bengali"

The following words are HIGH-confidence candidates for Munda loanwords in Bengali — these appear in serious scholarly work on Indo-Aryan substrate studies, with no plausible Sanskrit etymology and with phonological or semantic parallels in Munda languages:

| Bengali | Phonetic | Meaning | Semantic domain |
|---|---|---|---|
| ঢেঁকি | *dheki* | rice-husking lever | Food production |
| ঠাঙি / টাঙ্গি | *tangi* | axe | Tools |
| ঝাড় | *jhar* | forest, bush | Topography |
| ডাঙা | *danga* | highland, raised ground | Topography |
| হাঁড়ি | *hari* | earthen pot | Domestic objects |
| ঝিঙে | *jhinge* | ridge gourd | Food |

Notice the semantic domains. These are not words for abstract concepts. They are not words for divine attributes or celestial bodies or philosophical categories. They are words for: where the trees are, what the ground is like, what you cook in, what you eat, what you use to process grain, what you cut with. These are the words of daily survival — and they are the words that did not get replaced.

---

## The *jh-* Pattern

There is a phonological observation worth making here, with appropriate caution attached. Several proposed Munda loanwords and *deshi* words in Bengali share an initial *jh-* onset — that breathy, voiced cluster: ঝাড় (*jhar*), ঝিঙে (*jhinge*), and the food words ঝাল (*jhal*, "spicy/sharp") and ঝোল (*jhol*, "thin broth") that appear everywhere in Bengali cooking vocabulary.

The pattern is plausible as an Austroasiatic phonological inheritance. But I want to be direct about what the scholarly situation actually is: the specific etymologies of *jhāl* and *jhol* are genuinely unresolved. They are not from Sanskrit. They are possibly substrate. Their precise origin is *not yet demonstrated* to scholarly satisfaction. What can be said is that these words exist in a phonological neighborhood that looks consistent with what Munda substrate words look like. That is a pattern observation, not an etymology.

The same epistemic care applies to the onomatopoeia. ঝমঝম (*jhomjhom*), টিপটিপ (*tip tip*), গুড়গুড় (*gurgur*) — these are not loanwords in the ordinary sense. Sound-mimicry vocabulary is often independently invented in every language. But the *density* of this vocabulary in Bengali is notable. One plausible reading is that Bengali sits at the intersection of three substrate traditions — Austroasiatic (Munda), Tibeto-Burman (Bodo/Koch), and traces of North Dravidian — each independently rich in oral and sonic culture, and that this convergence produced a language with an unusual appetite for capturing texture and sound in words.

---

## Echo-Words: A Morphological Fingerprint

One feature of Bengali that linguists point to as likely Austroasiatic in origin is the *echo-word* or reduplication pattern. Bengali has a productive construction where any noun can be approximately doubled with a phonetically altered second copy to mean "X and things of that type":

ঘোড়াটোড়া (*ghora-tora*, from *ghora*, "horse") — "horses and such things"

কাপড়চোপড় (*kapur-chopur*, from *kapur*, "cloth") — "clothes and such things"

মাছটাছ (*mach-tach*, from *mach*, "fish") — "fish and similar things"

This pattern — technically called echo compounding — is highly characteristic of Austroasiatic languages and is found across Munda and Mon-Khmer language families. It is not a Sanskrit or Indo-Aryan feature. It got absorbed so deeply into Bengali morphology that speakers generate new echo-pairs spontaneously, without thinking. It is not a loan of *vocabulary*; it is a loan of *grammatical structure*. The Munda speakers left their morphological DNA inside the language even after the language itself was gone.

Bengali also has what linguists call numeral classifiers — the particles you must use when counting certain types of nouns. In English, you say "three fish." In Bengali, you say তিনটে মাছ (*tinte mach*) — literally "three [classifier for objects] fish." This classifier system (*ṭā*, *ṭi*, *khānā*, *jon*, and others) is another feature not found in Sanskrit but common across Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic language families. One more structural inheritance from the substrate.

---

## The Odia Connection

A brief note that will matter more in later posts: the thin-sour-spicy food axis I described — *jhol*, *jhal*, *tok* (টক, "sour"), *ombol* (অম্বল, "sourness; a sour preparation") — has structural cognates in Odia as well. The same thin broth, the same fermented-fish sensibility, the same balance of sourness and heat appear in Odia cooking with similar vocabulary. This is not a case of one language borrowing from the other recently. It is a shared inheritance — a food culture that was already present across the Bengal-Odisha-northeastern coastal zone before either Bengali or Odia existed as distinct literary languages, and that persisted in kitchens long after the prestige languages changed. The sour-thin-fish axis is an eastern substrate tradition, visible across Odia, Bengali, and northeastern cuisines, older than any of them.

---

## The Familiar Is the Ancient

Let me end here, with the inversion at the heart of this series.

When we think about what is "authentically Bengali," we typically reach for the high cultural markers: Tagore, the Charyapadas (the approximately tenth- to twelfth-century Buddhist devotional songs that are the oldest surviving Bengali literature), the literary tradition, the philosophical vocabulary. These feel like the *deep* Bengali. But linguistically, they are the *recent* layer — they are the Indo-Aryan stratum, the Sanskritic inheritance, the prestige vocabulary that arrived with a particular cultural-religious formation and was recorded in texts because texts survive.

The *deepest* Bengali — the oldest, the most continuous — is in the proverb about the <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" /> that keeps pounding paddy even in heaven. It is in the *kumir-danga* game where the flood is always coming and you scramble for high ground. It is in the <CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" /> and the <CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" /> and the thin sour fish broth that has no name in any language that came from the northwest. These words are older than the language itself. They are the vocabulary of people whose names we do not know, whose own languages are gone, but whose daily routines — pounding rice, cooking fish in thin sour broth, reading the ground for where the flood would not reach — survived inside the language that displaced them.

The words that feel most Bengali are probably the least Bengali in origin.

That is where this series begins.

মাছের টক ঝোল—জিনিসটা যে ঠিক কী, তা এমন কাউকে বোঝাতে গেলে রীতিমতো কালঘাম ছুটে যায় যিনি ছোটবেলা থেকে এটা খেয়ে বড় হননি।
কারি? আজ্ঞে না, কারি তো হয় বেশ ঘন, তেল-মশলাদার।
স্যুপ? নৈব নৈব চ\! স্যুপ ব্যাপারটা বড্ড ইউরোপীয়, তাতে ভুল কায়দায় চামচ ধরার একটা আনাড়িপনা আছে।

আমাদের ঝোল হলো পাতলা—প্রায় জলের মতো স্বচ্ছ। একটু হলুদ, একটু লঙ্কা, রুই-কাতলা হলে জিরে ফোড়ন, পাবদা ইলিশ হলে সর্ষে ফোড়ন। মাছের টক ঝোল করলে একটু টকটক। টক ভাবটা হয়তো আসে তেঁতুল বা কাঁচা আম থেকে, বা নিদেনপক্ষে সর্ষের তেলের ঝাঁঝ থেকে।মাছ—সে তো সব সময় মিষ্টি জলের, একটু-আধটু কাঁটাওয়ালা, আর সেই পাতলা ঝোলের মধ্যে মাছটা যেন ভারী পরিমিতভাবে নিজের অস্তিত্বটুকু টিকিয়ে রেখেছে। আর এর সবকিছুর নিচে, বিশেষ করে পূর্ববঙ্গে, লুকিয়ে থাকে শিদল নামের এক মজানো বা ফারমেন্টেড শুঁটকি মাছের পেস্ট, যার গন্ধে নিরস ব্যাক্তিবিশেষের বমিরসের উদ্রেক হয় —ঠিক ভিয়েতনামী রান্নায় ফিশ সসের মতন : একেবারে অদৃশ্য, অথচ অপরিহার্য এবং আটপৌরে ।

মাছের টক ঝোলের কথা তুললাম কারণ এখান থেকেই আমার এই লেখার সিরিজের  সূত্রপাত। কোনো কেতাবী ব্যাকরণ বা পান্ডিত্য  ফলাতে নয়—বরং এক বাটি ঝোলের সামনে বসে, যার কোনো ইন্দো-আর্য্য  ব্যুৎপত্তি  নেই। দক্ষিণ-পূর্ব এশিয়ার অন্যান্য জায়গায় খাওয়া খাবারগুলোর সাথে এর অদ্ভুত কাঠামোগত মিল। ভিয়েতনামী *canh chua* বা বর্মী *mohinga*\-র রাইস নুডল ব্রথের মধ্যে Ngapi পেস্ট সেই একই 'পাতলা-টক-মাছ'-এর যুগলবন্দি। এগুলো যে একই সুতোর গাঁথা, সেটা হয়তো আমি অকাট্যভাবে প্রমাণ করতে পারব না।

কিন্তু এই প্যাটার্নটা এতটা প্রকট যে একে অগ্রাহ্য করাও মুশকিল।

পাতলা-টক-মাছের এই খাদ্যসংস্কৃতি উত্তর-পশ্চিম দিক থেকে আসা কোনো কিছুর অনুকরণ নয়, সংস্কৃত-বলা পুরোহিতদের দান নয়, গাঙ্গেয় সমভূমির বুকের জিনিসও নয়। এটা আসলে বাংলার চেয়েও প্রাচীন। আমাদের হাতে থাকা যেকোনো লিখিত পুঁথির চেয়ে পুরনো। আর ওই যে শিদল—ব্রাহ্মণ্যবাদী রান্নার কোনো বইতে এর টিকিও খুঁজে পাবেন না। কারণ এটা তাঁদের খাবার ছিলই না। এটা ছিল সেইসব মানুষদের খাবার, যাঁরা এই মাটিতে সংস্কৃত বা প্রাকৃত শব্দগুলো এসে পৌঁছনোর অনেক আগে থেকেই বাস করতেন।

জার্মানিতে, বিশেষত বার্লিনে, থাকার জন্য ভিয়েতনামিজ খাবারের অভিজ্ঞতা।  যখন পাঞ্জাবি বা উত্তর ভারতীয় রেস্টুরেন্টের খাবারে মন ভরেনা, তখন আমার জন্য টম ইয়াম স্যুপ অমৃতসম। একটু একটু আমের টক ঝোল টাইপের মনে হয় \- কিন্তু লেমনগ্রাস আর লেবুর রস দিয়ে টক, আম দিয়ে নয়।

বাঙালি সংস্কৃতির সবচেয়ে গভীর স্তরগুলো সেখানে নেই, যেখানে আমরা সাধারণত খুঁজি। তার বাস আমাদের হেঁশেলে। আমাদের মজ্জায় মজ্জায় । এমন কিছু শব্দে, যেগুলো শুনলে সবচেয়ে বেশি 'বাংলা' মনে হয়—এবং আমি তর্কে নামতে রাজি যে, সেগুলোই সম্ভবত আমাদের ভাষার সবচেয়ে *প্রাচীন* অ-বাংলা শব্দ।

---

### চূড়ান্তভাবে  "বাঙালি" শব্দ

আপনাদের একটা ফর্দ দিই। এই শব্দগুলো নিয়েই আমার বড় হয়ে ওঠা, একেবারে অস্থিমজ্জায় মিশে থাকা শব্দ—যেগুলো ঠিক ব্যাকরণ পড়ে শিখতে হয়নি, হাওয়া থেকে শুষে নিয়েছি:

ঢেঁকি — লম্বাটে সেই কাঠের যন্ত্র, পায়ে চাপ দিয়ে গাঁয়ের মেয়েরা রোজ সকালে ধান ভানত। আমি যদিও আদ্যোপান্ত শহরের ছেলে, তবুও "ঢেঁকি স্বর্গে গেলেও ধান ভানে" প্রবাদটা শুনেই বড় হয়েছি। কিছু জিনিসের স্বভাব কখনো বদলায় না\!

পটল — এমন একটা বাঙালি আনাজ, যা ভূ-ভারতের আর কোথাও বিশেষ পাত্তা পায় না। দিল্লির কোনো বন্ধুকে পটল চেনাতে গেছেন কখনও? (অবশ্য আয়ুর্বেদ শাস্ত্রে সংস্কৃতে 'পটোলা' শব্দের উল্লেখ আছে, তাই পটল হয়তো একেবারে দেশি শব্দ নয়, তদ্ভব হতে পারে; কিন্তু এর আটপৌরে বাঙালিয়ানার জন্যই একে এই তালিকায় রাখলাম, ব্যুৎপত্তিগত অস্বচ্ছতার জন্য নয়।) \-- তবে আমার ছোটবেলায় বড়ো বিঁচি ওয়ালা পটল খেলেই বমি পেতো।

ঝিঙে — এ আরেক রত্ন। ইশারা করে হয়তো বোঝানো যায়, কিন্তু মঙ্গলবার দুপুরে ঝিঙে-পোস্তর স্বাদ কোনো ভিনদেশি ভাষায় তর্জমা করবেন কীভাবে?

ডাঙা — স্কুলের মাঠে আমরা 'কুমির \-ডাঙা' খেলতাম: একজন 'কুমির ' (বন্যা বা চোর), আর অন্য বাচ্চারা  কেবল 'ডাঙা' বা উঁচু কোনো জায়গায় উঠলেই নিরাপদ। ভেবে দেখুন তো, আবহমান নিচু-জমিতে বাংলার বন্যার যে চিরন্তন আতঙ্ক, সেটাই কেমন সুন্দর একটা ছোটদের খেলার মধ্যে ঢুকে বসে আছে\!

হাঁড়ি — রান্না করা, জল আনা, চাল-ডাল রাখার সেই মাটির পাত্র। বাঙালি সংসারের সবচেয়ে পরিচিত জিনিসটার নাম ঠিক এমনই।

আর তারপর আসে আমাদের ধ্বন্যাত্মক শব্দগুলো (Onomatopoeia)—সে এক আলাদা জগৎ\! শুধু শব্দের অনুকরণে তৈরি হওয়া অদ্ভুত সব শব্দে বাংলা ভাষা রীতিমতো জমজমাট:

ঝমঝম — টিনের চালে প্রবল বর্ষার বৃষ্টির শব্দ।

টিপটিপ — হালকা ঝিরঝিরে বৃষ্টি, যেন একটু কাঁচুমাচু হয়ে পড়ছে।

গুড়গুড় — বহু দূরের মেঘ ডাকার সেই নিচু গর্জন।

সংস্কৃত অভিধান ঘেঁটে এগুলোর কোনো হদিস পাবেন না। ইন্দো-আর্য ব্যুৎপত্তি দিয়ে এদের মাজাঘষা করা যায় না। এগুলো আদ্যোপান্ত, অকাট্যভাবে বাঙালি—যাদের উৎস খোঁজা মুশকিল, পুরোপুরি তর্জমা করা অসম্ভব, আর কোনো হিন্দিভাষী প্রথমবারের জন্য এগুলো শুনলে তাঁকে বোঝানো তো আরও কঠিন।
মাঝেমাঝে মনে হয় যে এতগুলো রকমের ব্যাথা-যন্ত্রনা ব্যক্ত করতে পারে বাঙালি তাই হয়তো বাংলার ডাক্তারদের রপ্তানি পাশ্চাত্যে।

বিশ্বাস করুন এটাই সবচেয়ে বড় ক্ল্যু\!

### এবারে আসল কথায়

এই প্রথম লেখাটায় আমি একটা মোদ্দা কথা বলে রাখতে চাই, কারণ এই সিরিজের বাকি লেখাগুলো এই ভিত্তির ওপরই দাঁড়িয়ে থাকবে:

**যে শব্দগুলোকে আমাদের সবচেয়ে বেশি 'বাংলা' বলে মনে হয়, সেগুলো সম্ভবত বাংলা ভাষার সবচেয়ে প্রাচীন 'অ-বাংলা' শব্দ।**

এই যে চূড়ান্ত 'বাঙালি' শব্দগুলো, হেঁশেলের শব্দগুলো, ভূপ্রকৃতি, যন্ত্রপাতি বা বৃষ্টির শব্দ—এগুলো হলো অবশিষ্টাংশ।

কোনো একটা ভাষা, সভ্যতা, জীবনশৈলী  যখন অন্য ভাষার দ্বারা প্রতিস্থাপিত হয় \--মানুষগুলো থেকে যায়। এই শব্দগুলোই টিকে থাকে। ইন্দো-আর্য ভাষাভাষীরা আসার হাজার হাজার বছর আগে থেকে যাঁরা বাংলায় বাস করতেন, যাঁদের ভাষা ধীরে ধীরে কোণঠাসা হয়ে একসময় পুরোপুরি গিলে খাওয়া হয়েছিল \-- এটা সেই প্রাচীন জনগোষ্ঠীর ভূতুড়ে শব্দভাণ্ডার। কিন্তু তাঁদের দৈনন্দিন শব্দগুলো—যেগুলো রোজ সকালে হেঁশেলে, ঢেঁকি-তে, উৎসবের ঢাক ও ঢোলে, মাঠে-ঘাটে, বৃষ্টিতে ব্যবহৃত হতো—সেগুলো কিছুতেই এ দেশ ছেড়ে যেতে রাজি হয়নি।

এমনটা কেন হয়, তা বুঝতে গেলে ভাষার আদানপ্রদান বা 'Language contact'-এর সময় শব্দভাণ্ডার কীভাবে কাজ করে, সেটা বোঝা দরকার। আভিজাত্যের মোড়কে থাকা গালভরা শব্দগুলো—যেমন ধর্ম, আইন, দর্শন বা জ্যোতির্বিজ্ঞানের শব্দ—খুব দ্রুত পালটে যায়। সমাজের উচ্চবিত্তরা নতুন ভাষার শব্দগুলো আপন করে নেয়, আর পুরনো শব্দগুলো দু-এক প্রজন্মের মধ্যেই হাওয়া হয়ে যায়। কিন্তু হেঁশেলের শব্দের হিসেবটা আলাদা। হেঁশেলের শব্দ ক্লাসরুমে বা মন্দিরে বসে শেখানো হয় না; তা রান্নার ফাঁকে ফাঁকে বয়স্কদের থেকে ছোটদের মধ্যে সংক্রমিত হয়। মাটির পাত্রটাকে তোলার কথা বলতে গেলে যে শব্দটা মুখ দিয়ে বেরোয়, সেটাই টিকে থাকে। এটা পড়ানো হয় না, হাতেকলমে দেখানো হয়। বইয়ের পাতায় থাকে আভিজাত্য, আর মানুষের শরীরে, হেঁশেলে, ছড়ায় থাকে শেকড়।

সংস্কৃতে ধান ভানার যন্ত্রটির নাম 'উলূখল' (হামানদিস্তা) এবং 'মুসল' (নোড়া)। এই শব্দগুলো টিকে আছে ঠিকই—কিন্তু তা কেবল পুঁথিতে, সংস্কৃত অভিধানে, বা ব্রাহ্মণ্যবাদী আচার-অনুষ্ঠানে। কিন্তু বাংলার যে আটপৌরে মানুষটি রোজ সকালে ধান ভানতেন, তিনি এই পুরো যন্ত্রটাকে ঢেঁকি বলেই ডাকতেন। আর এই 'ঢেঁকি' কিন্তু সংস্কৃত নয়। এর কোনো সংস্কৃত ব্যুৎপত্তিও নেই। ঐতিহাসিক ভাষাতত্ত্বের বর্তমান পণ্ডিতদের মতে, এই শব্দটা এসেছে অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক (Austroasiatic) ভাষাভাষী মানুষদের কাছ থেকে, যাঁরা ইন্দো-আর্যরা আসার বহু আগে থেকেই বাংলায় ছিলেন। এঁদের ভাষা আধুনিক মুন্ডা ভাষাগুলোর (যেমন সাঁওতালি, মুন্ডারি, হো) আত্মীয়, যা আজ ঝাড়খণ্ড এবং পশ্চিম ওড়িশার উচ্চভূমিতে টিকে আছে। সেখানকার মানুষরা নিজেদের এই মাটির আদি বাসিন্দা বলে দাবি করেন এবং তাঁদের লোককথাতেও সে কথার সমর্থন মেলে। জেনেটিক গবেষণাও—বিশেষ করে ডেভিড রাইখ-এর (David Reich) ল্যাবে প্রাচীন দক্ষিণ এশিয়ার জনসংখ্যার ইতিহাস নিয়ে কাজ এবং পল সিডওয়েল-এর ২০১৮ সালের অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক উৎস সংক্রান্ত গবেষণা—এই ধারণাকেই সিলমোহর দিচ্ছে: আজ থেকে প্রায় ৪,০০০ বছর আগে পূর্ব দিক থেকে পুরুষ-প্রধান একটি অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক ভাষাভাষী গোষ্ঠী পূর্ব ভারতে প্রবেশ করেছিল।

### শব্দভাণ্ডারের কাটাছেঁড়া

ভাষাতাত্ত্বিক সুনীতিকুমার চট্টোপাধ্যায় ১৯২৬ সালে তাঁর যুগান্তকারী কাজ *Origin and Development of the Bengali Language* (সংক্ষেপে ODBL) প্রকাশ করেন—যা আজও বাংলা ঐতিহাসিক ভাষাতত্ত্বের ভিত্তিমূল। বাংলা শব্দভাণ্ডার নিয়ে তাঁর দেওয়া হিসেবটা একটু তলিয়ে দেখার মতো:

বাংলা শব্দভাণ্ডারের প্রায় **৪৪%** হলো তৎসম ("তার সমান")—যেগুলো সামান্য রদবদল হয়ে সরাসরি সংস্কৃত থেকে এসেছে। ধর্ম। কর্ম। বৃক্ষ। এগুলো হলো সেই আভিজাত্যের ধার করা শব্দ, ব্রাহ্মণ্যবাদী স্তর, যা পুরোহিত আর পুঁথির হাত ধরে এসেছিল।

বাকি **প্রায় ৫৬%** শব্দকে আরও দুটো ভাগে ভাগ করা যায়: তদ্ভব ("তা থেকে উৎপন্ন")—যেগুলোর জন্ম হয়তো সংস্কৃত বা প্রাকৃতে, কিন্তু কালক্রমে এতটাই পালটে গেছে যে চেনা দায়—এবং দেশী ("দেশের নিজস্ব")—যেগুলো কোনো অজানা বা অ-আর্য উৎস থেকে এসেছে এবং সংস্কৃতের কোনো ধার না ধেরেই বাংলায় সগর্বে টিকে আছে।

এই 'দেশী' খোপটার মধ্যেই আমাদের আরামের শব্দগুলোর বাস। ঢেঁকি। হাঁড়ি। ঝিঙে। ডাঙা। আপনার ঠাকুমা-দিদিমারা রোজ যে শব্দগুলো ব্যবহার করতেন।

### মুন্ডা ভাষার প্রলেপ

ভাষাতাত্ত্বিকরা 'সাবস্ট্রেট' (substrate) বলে একটা গালভরা শব্দ ব্যবহার করেন—যখন কোনো প্রাচীন ভাষা অন্য ভাষা দ্বারা প্রতিস্থাপিত হওয়ার পরেও তার শব্দ, ধ্বনি বা ব্যাকরণের কিছু বৈশিষ্ট্য নতুন ভাষার মধ্যে টিকে যায়। বাংলা ভাষায় অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক ভাষার এক বিশাল সাবস্ট্রেট বা ভিত্তিস্বরুপ প্রভাব রয়েছে, বিশেষ করে মুন্ডা ভাষার। এ ছাড়াও উত্তর ও উত্তর-পূর্বাঞ্চলে টিবেটো-বার্মান (বোড়ো/কোচ) ভাষার একটি গৌণ প্রভাবও দেখা যায়।

"অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক" হলো এমন এক ভাষাগোষ্ঠী যার মধ্যে বর্তমানে পূর্ব ভারতের মুন্ডা ভাষাগুলো (সাঁওতালি, মুন্ডারি, হো) এবং দক্ষিণ-পূর্ব এশিয়ার মন-খমের (Mon-Khmer) ভাষাগুলো (ভিয়েতনামী, খমের, মন) পড়ে। এই নামকরণ থেকেই বোঝা যায় যে, একসময় ভারত থেকে দক্ষিণ-পূর্ব এশিয়া পর্যন্ত এক বিশাল অঞ্চল জুড়ে এই ভাষার বিস্তার ছিল, যা পরে অন্যান্য অভিবাসনের চাপে সংকুচিত হয়ে যায়। ঝাড়খণ্ড এবং ওড়িশার মুন্ডা ভাষাভাষীরাই দক্ষিণ এশিয়ায় এই গোষ্ঠীর সবচেয়ে পশ্চিম প্রান্তের জীবিত নিদর্শন।

অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক এবং টিবেটো-বার্মান ভাষাগোষ্ঠীর মধ্যে  একটা মিল আছে \-- ব্যাকরণে পুংলিঙ্গ-স্ত্রীলিঙ্গের ধার ধারেনা। এবং মাগধী প্রাকৃতের হাত ধরে পূর্বভারতের যে ভাষাগুলোর জন্ম \-- বাংলা, অসমীয়া, ওড়িয়া, ভোজপুরি ইত্যাদি \-- সেগুলোতেও  ব্যাকরণে লিঙ্গের অপঘাতে মৃত্যু হয়েছে।

নিচের শব্দগুলোকে অত্যন্ত প্রবলভাবে মুন্ডা ভাষার ধার করা শব্দ বলে মনে করা হয়—ইন্দো-আর্য ভাষার সাবস্ট্রেট নিয়ে গবেষণায় পণ্ডিতরা এগুলোকে স্বীকৃতি দিয়েছেন। এদের কোনো সংস্কৃত ব্যুৎপত্তি নেই, বরং মুন্ডা ভাষার সাথে ধ্বনিগত বা অর্থগত গভীর মিল রয়েছে:

| বাংলা | উচ্চারণ | অর্থ | শব্দার্থের পরিমণ্ডল |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ঢেঁকি | *dheki* | ধান ভানার যন্ত্র | খাদ্য প্রক্রিয়াকরণ |
| ঠাঙি / টাঙ্গি | *tangi* | কুঠার | যন্ত্রপাতি |
| ঝাড় | *jhar* | জঙ্গল, ঝোপ | ভূপ্রকৃতি |
| ডাঙা | *danga* | উঁচু জমি | ভূপ্রকৃতি |
| হাঁড়ি | *hari* | মাটির পাত্র | গৃহস্থালির জিনিস |
| ঝিঙে | *jhinge* | এক ধরনের আনাজ | খাবার |

খেয়াল করে দেখুন শব্দগুলো কোন ধরণের জীবনযাত্রা  থেকে আসছে। এগুলো কোনো বিমূর্ত দর্শনের শব্দ নয়। দেবতার গুণগান বা মহাজাগতিক বস্তু বোঝানোর শব্দও নয়। এগুলো হলো: কোথায় গাছপালা আছে, মাটির ধরন কেমন, কিসে রান্না করবেন, কী খাবেন, ধান ভানবেন কিসে, আর কী দিয়ে কাটবেন। এগুলো হলো রোজকার বেঁচে থাকার শব্দ—আর ঠিক এই শব্দগুলোই কেউ মুছে  দিতে  পারেনি।

### 'ঝ'-এর ঝঞ্ঝাট

এখানে ধ্বনিতত্ত্বের একটা মজার দিকের কথা না বললেই নয়, তবে একটু সাবধানতার সাথেই বলছি। বাংলায় প্রস্তাবিত বেশ কিছু মুন্ডা এবং 'দেশী' শব্দের শুরুতে একটা 'ঝ' (jh-) ধ্বনি খেয়াল করা যায়—সেই শ্বাসবহুল, ঘোষ মহাপ্রাণ ধ্বনিটা: ঝাড়, ঝিঙে, এবং বাংলা রান্নার অবিচ্ছেদ্য অঙ্গ ঝাল ও ঝোল।

অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক ধ্বনিতত্ত্বের উত্তরাধিকার হিসেবে এই প্যাটার্নটা যথেষ্ট যুক্তিসঙ্গত। কিন্তু গবেষকরা এখনো এব্যাপারে একমত নন : 'ঝাল' আর 'ঝোল'-এর ব্যুৎপত্তিগত উৎস নিয়ে সত্যিই এখনও যথেষ্ট ধোঁয়াশা আছে। এগুলো যে সংস্কৃত নয়, সে বিষয়ে কোনো সন্দেহ নেই। এগুলো 'সাবস্ট্রেট' বা প্রাচীন ভিত্তিমূল থেকে আসাও খুব স্বাভাবিক। কিন্তু কোনো অকাট্য প্রমাণ এখনও মেলেনি। তবে হ্যাঁ, এই শব্দগুলো এমন একটা ধ্বনিগত পরিমণ্ডলে ঘোরাফেরা করে, যা মুন্ডা সাবস্ট্রেট শব্দের মতোই দেখতে। এটাকে একটা প্যাটার্ন বা ধরন হিসেবে দেখা যেতে পারে, তবে নিশ্চিত ব্যুৎপত্তি বলা চলে না।

একই কথা খাটে আমাদের ধ্বন্যাত্মক শব্দগুলোর ক্ষেত্রেও। ঝমঝম, টিপটিপ, গুড়গুড়—এগুলো ঠিক সাধারণ অর্থে ধার করা শব্দ নয়। শব্দের অনুকরণ করে তৈরি করা পদ প্রায় সব ভাষাতেই নিজের মতো করে গজিয়ে ওঠে। কিন্তু বাংলা ভাষায় এই ধরনের শব্দের *প্রাচুর্য্য়*  সত্যিই অবাক করার মতো। এর একটা সম্ভাব্য কারণ হতে পারে যে, বাংলা ভাষা তিনটে প্রাচীন ভাষার মোহনায় বসে আছে—অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক (মুন্ডা), টিবেটো-বার্মান (বোড়ো/কোচ), আর সামান্য উত্তর-দ্রাবিড়—যাদের প্রত্যেকের নিজস্ব সমৃদ্ধ মৌখিক ও ধ্বনিগত সংস্কৃতি ছিল। আর এই তিনের মিলনেই হয়তো এমন এক ভাষার জন্ম হয়েছে, যার পরতে পরতে শব্দ আর ধ্বনির বুনন মেলানোর  এক অদম্য খিদে লুকিয়ে আছে।

### প্রতিধ্বনি-শব্দ: ব্যাকরণের অস্থিমজ্জায়

ভাষাতাত্ত্বিকরা বাংলার যে বৈশিষ্ট্যটিকে সবচেয়ে বেশি অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক প্রভাব বলে মনে করেন, তা হলো 'প্রতিধ্বনি-শব্দ' বা অনুকার শব্দের (echo-word) ব্যবহার। বাংলায় একটা দারুণ মজার ব্যাপার হলো, যেকোনো বিশেষ্য পদের সাথে ধ্বনিটা সামান্য পালটে একটা দ্বিতীয় শব্দ জুড়ে দিয়ে "ওই জাতীয় জিনিসপত্র" বোঝানো যায়:

ঘোড়াটোড়া (ঘোড়া থেকে) — "ঘোড়া এবং ওই জাতীয় কিছু"

কাপড়চোপড় (কাপড় থেকে) — "জামাকাপড় ইত্যাদি"

মাছটাছ (মাছ থেকে) — "মাছ বা ওই ধরনের জিনিস"

এই প্যাটার্নটাকে—যাকে পরিভাষায় echo compounding বলা হয়—অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক ভাষার একটা অন্যতম প্রধান বৈশিষ্ট্য হিসেবে ধরা হয়, যা মুন্ডা এবং মন-খমের ভাষাগোষ্ঠীতে অহরহ দেখা যায়। এটা আদৌ সংস্কৃত বা ইন্দো-আর্য ভাষার কোনো বৈশিষ্ট্য নয়। কিন্তু এটা বাংলা ব্যাকরণের অস্থিমজ্জায় এতটাই গভীরভাবে সেঁধিয়ে গেছে যে, আমরা অবচেতনভাবেই কথায় কথায় নতুন নতুন শব্দজোড় তৈরি করে ফেলি। এটা নিছক শব্দের ধার নয়, এ হলো একেবারে ব্যাকরণ বা গঠনের ধার\! মুন্ডা ভাষাগোষ্ঠীর মানুষজন ভাষাটা হারিয়ে ফেললেও, ভাষার কাঠামোর ভেতর নিজেদের ডিএনএ-টা ঠিকই রেখে গেছেন।

তাছাড়া, বাংলায় 'numeral classifiers' বলেও একটা ব্যাপার আছে—কোনো কিছু গুনতে গেলে যে লগ্নকগুলো জুড়ে দিতে হয়। ইংরেজিতে বলা হয় "three fish" (তিন মাছ)। বাংলায় আমরা বলি তিনটে মাছ—অর্থাৎ "তিন \[বস্তু নির্দেশক\] মাছ"। এই ক্লাসিফায়ার সিস্টেমটা ('টি', 'টা', 'খানা', 'জন' ইত্যাদি) সংস্কৃতের ত্রিসীমানায় নেই, কিন্তু টিবেটো-বার্মান এবং অস্ট্রোএশিয়াটিক ভাষাগোষ্ঠীতে এর ছড়াছড়ি। প্রাচীন ভাষার সেই সাবস্ট্রেট বা ভিত্তিমূলের এ আরও এক কাঠামোগত উত্তরাধিকার।

### ওড়িয়া যোগসূত্র

এই প্রসঙ্গে ছোট্ট করে একটা কথা বলে রাখি, যা পরের লেখাগুলোতে কাজে লাগবে: রান্নার যে পাতলা-টক-ঝাল যুগলবন্দির কথা বলছিলাম—ঝোল, ঝাল, টক, অম্বল—ওড়িয়া ভাষাতেও এর হুবহু মিল পাওয়া যায়। ওড়িয়া রান্নাতেও ঠিক এই একই পাতলা ঝোল, ফারমেন্টেড মাছের প্রতি দুর্বলতা, এবং টক আর ঝালের একই রকম ভারসাম্য দেখা যায়, আর শব্দগুলোও প্রায় একই। এটা কিন্তু সম্প্রতি এক ভাষার অন্য ভাষা থেকে ধার করা নয়। এটা একটা যৌথ উত্তরাধিকার—এমন এক খাদ্যসংস্কৃতি, যা বাংলা আর ওড়িয়া আলাদা সাহিত্যিক ভাষা হিসেবে গড়ে ওঠার বহু আগে থেকেই বাংলা-ওড়িশা-উত্তরপূর্বের উপকূলবর্তী অঞ্চলে বিদ্যমান ছিল। আভিজাত্যের ভাষা পালটে যাওয়ার বহুকাল পরেও তা হেঁশেলে টিকে থেকেছে। টক-পাতলা-মাছের এই ধারাটি হলো পূর্বাঞ্চলের এক প্রাচীন সাবস্ট্রেট ঐতিহ্য, যা ওড়িয়া, বাংলা এবং উত্তর-পূর্বের খাবারে ছড়িয়ে আছে, এবং যা এই ভাষাগুলোর চেয়েও প্রাচীন।

### চেনা জিনিসটাই সবচেয়ে প্রাচীন

চলুন, আজকের মতো এখানেই শেষ করি—এই গোটা সিরিজের মূলে থাকা একটা অদ্ভুত বৈপরীত্যের কথা বলে।

আমরা যখন ভাবি "খাঁটি বাঙালি" জিনিসটা ঠিক কী, তখন স্বভাবতই আমাদের চোখ যায় উচ্চমার্গের সংস্কৃতির দিকে: রবীন্দ্রনাথ, চর্যাপদ (দশম থেকে দ্বাদশ শতকের বৌদ্ধ সাধনসঙ্গীত, যা বাংলার প্রাচীনতম লিখিত নিদর্শন), আমাদের সাহিত্যিক ঐতিহ্য, কিম্বা দর্শনের ভারী ভারী শব্দ। মনে হয়, এগুলোই বুঝি আমাদের শেকড়, 'গভীর' বাঙালিয়ানা। কিন্তু ভাষাতাত্ত্বিক দিক থেকে দেখলে, এগুলো হলো অনেক *সাম্প্রতিক* স্তর—এগুলো ইন্দো-আর্য স্তর, সংস্কৃতের উত্তরাধিকার, আভিজাত্যের শব্দভাণ্ডার যা একটা নির্দিষ্ট সাংস্কৃতিক-ধর্মীয় কাঠামোর হাত ধরে এসেছিল এবং পুঁথিতে জায়গা পেয়েছিল বলেই আজ অবধি টিকে আছে।

আমাদের সবচেয়ে *গভীর* বাঙালিয়ানা—সবচেয়ে প্রাচীন, সবচেয়ে নিরবচ্ছিন্ন স্রোতটা—লুকিয়ে আছে ওই ঢেঁকি-র প্রবাদে, যা স্বর্গে গিয়েও ধান ভানে। তা লুকিয়ে আছে সেই 'কুমির-ডাঙা' খেলায়, যেখানে বন্যা রোজ ধেয়ে আসে আর বাঁচার জন্য আমাদের উঁচু ডাঙা খুঁজতে হয়। তা লুকিয়ে আছে রোজকার হাঁড়ি-তে, ঝিঙে-তে আর সেই পাতলা টক মাছের ঝোলে, উত্তর-পশ্চিম থেকে আসা কোনো ভাষায় যার কোনো নামই নেই। এই শব্দগুলো আমাদের ভাষার চেয়েও প্রাচীন। এগুলো এমন সব মানুষদের শব্দ, যাঁদের নাম আমরা জানি না, যাঁদের ভাষা আজ বিলুপ্ত, কিন্তু যাঁদের রোজকার রুটিন—ধান ভানা, পাতলা টক ঝোলে মাছ রাঁধা, আর বন্যা থেকে বাঁচতে মাটির চরিত্র বোঝা—সেই ভাষারই ভেতরে সগর্বে টিকে আছে, যে ভাষা একদিন তাঁদের কোণঠাসা করেছিল।

যে শব্দগুলোকে আমাদের সবচেয়ে বেশি খাঁটি বাংলা বলে মনে হয়, উৎসের দিক থেকে সেগুলো সম্ভবত সবচেয়ে কম বাংলা।

আর ঠিক এখান থেকেই আমাদের এই লেখার সিরিজের  সূত্রপাত।
