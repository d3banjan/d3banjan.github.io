There is a dish that Bengalis eat at home that I cannot translate.

মাছের ঝোল (*maacher jhol*, "fish in thin broth") — the name itself dissolves into something pre-linguistic when I try to explain it to someone who did not grow up eating it. Not a curry, which implies thickness and richness. Not a soup, which implies Europe and a spoon held the wrong way. A *jhol* is thin. Almost clear. Slightly sour. The fish — always freshwater, always a little bony, always correct — barely holds together in it. The sourness might come from tamarind or dried raw mango or sometimes just the sharpness of mustard oil. And underneath everything, in east Bengal, there is a fermented fish paste called শিদল (*shidal*) that functions the way fish sauce functions in Vietnamese cooking: invisible, essential, ancestral.

I mention *maacher jhol* because it is where this whole series starts for me. Not with grammar or cognates or scholarly apparatus, but with a bowl of something that has no Indo-Aryan explanation. What strikes me is the structural resemblance to things I have eaten elsewhere in Southeast Asia — the sour-thin-fish logic that appears in Vietnamese *canh chua*, or the rice-noodle broth of Burmese *mohinga*. I cannot prove these are related. But the pattern is notable enough to sit with. The thin-sour-fish food tradition is not an adaptation of anything that came from the northwest, from Sanskrit-speaking priests, from the plains of the Gangetic heartland. It is older than Bengali. It predates every text we have. And the fermented fish paste, শিদল (*shidal*), never once appears in a Brahminical cooking manual. Because it was not their food. It was the food of the people who were here before their words arrived.

The deepest layers of Bengali culture are not where we usually look for them. They are in the kitchen. They are in the body. They are in the words that feel the most Bengali — which are, as I will argue, probably the *oldest* non-Bengali words in the language.

---

## The Comfort Words

Let me give you an inventory. These are words I grew up with, words that feel bone-deep, words I did not learn so much as absorb:

<CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" /> (*dheki*, "rice-husking lever") — the tall wooden contraption, worked by foot, that women used every morning to pound rice in villages. I was a townie — but I did grow up with the proverb: *ঢেঁকি স্বর্গে গেলেও ধান ভানে* (*dheki shorge geleo dhaan bhaane*, "even if the rice-husking lever goes to heaven, it pounds paddy there"). Some things do not stop being what they are.

পটল (*potol*, "pointed gourd") — a vegetable so Bengali it barely exists anywhere else. Try explaining it to someone from Delhi. (Sanskrit *paṭola* exists in Ayurvedic texts, so *potol* may be a tadbhava form rather than a deshi word; I include it for its cultural feel, not its etymological opacity.)

<CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" /> (*jhinge*, "ridge gourd") — another one. You can gesture at it. You cannot translate the way it tastes on a Tuesday.

<CognateTooltip latin="danga" bengali="ডাঙা" meaning="highland, raised ground above flood line" /> (*danga*, "highland, raised ground above the flood line") — we used to play *জল-ডাঙা* (*jol-danga*, "water-land") in the schoolyard: one child is *jol* (flood, "it"), and you are safe only on *danga* (raised ground, any elevated surface). The whole hydrological anxiety of Bengal, compressed into a children's game.

<CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" /> (*hari*, "earthen pot") — the vessel for cooking, for carrying water, for storing grain. The most domestic object in the Bengali universe has this name.

And then the onomatopoeia, which is its own world. Bengali has an astonishing number of words that are pure sound mimicry:

ঝমঝম (*jhomjhom*) — the sound of heavy monsoon rain on a tin roof.

টিপটিপ (*tip tip*) — the sound of gentle drizzle, almost apologetic.

গুড়গুড় (*gurgur*) — the low rumble of distant thunder.

These are not words you find in Sanskrit dictionaries. These are not words that Indo-Aryan etymology explains. They feel *irreducibly Bengali* — impossible to trace, impossible to fully translate, inexplicable to a Hindi speaker who encounters them for the first time.

And that, it turns out, is exactly the clue.

---

## The Provocation

Here is the argument I want to make in this first post, because it reframes everything that follows in this series:

**The words that feel most Bengali are probably the oldest non-Bengali words in the language.**

The comfort words, the kitchen words, the words for topography and tools and rain — these are the residue. They are what survives when a language is replaced but a people are not. They are the ghost vocabulary of populations who lived in Bengal for thousands of years before any Indo-Aryan speaker arrived, whose languages were gradually displaced and then swallowed whole, but whose words — the ones used every morning in the kitchen, at the <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" />, at the ঢাক and ঢোল (*dhak* and *dhol*, the festival drums), in the fields, in the rain — refused to leave.

To understand why this happens, you need to understand something about how vocabulary works under language contact. Technical terms from prestige domains — religion, law, philosophy, astronomy — get replaced fast. The elites adopt the new language's terms, and the old words disappear within a generation or two. But kitchen vocabulary is different. Kitchen vocabulary is transmitted from the older cook to their younger family members in the middle of cooking, not in classrooms or temples. The word for the earthen pot is what you say when you tell a child to pick it up. It is not taught; it is demonstrated. Prestige vocabulary lives in texts. Kitchen vocabulary lives in bodies.

The Sanskrit word for the rice-husking apparatus is *ulūkhala* (for the mortar) and *musala* (for the pestle). These words survived — in texts, in Sanskrit dictionaries, in Brahminical ritual contexts. But every Bengali villager who pounded rice every morning called the whole contraption a <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" />. And *dheki* is not Sanskrit. It has no Sanskrit etymology. It is, in the best current assessment of historical linguistics, a word inherited from the Austroasiatic-speaking peoples who were in Bengal before the Indo-Aryan languages arrived — peoples who spoke languages related to modern Munda languages like Santali, Mundari, and Ho, which survive today in the highlands of Jharkhand and western Odisha, spoken by communities who call themselves the original inhabitants of the land. They have oral traditions that say so. Genetic studies — particularly work by David Reich's lab on ancient South Asian population history and Paul Sidwell's 2018 synthesis on Austroasiatic origins — are beginning to corroborate the broad outline: a male-biased migration of Austroasiatic speakers into eastern India, arriving from the east, roughly 4,000 years ago.

## The Vocabulary Breakdown

The linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji published his monumental *Origin and Development of the Bengali Language* (abbreviated ODBL) in 1926 — still the foundational scholarly work on Bengali historical linguistics. His count of the Bengali lexicon produced a figure that is worth sitting with:

Approximately **44%** of Bengali vocabulary is *tatsama* — তৎসম (*tôtsôm*, "same as that") — words taken directly from Sanskrit with minimal alteration. *Dharma*. *Karma*. বৃক্ষ (*briksha*, "tree"). These are the prestige loans, the Brahminical layer, the words that came with the priests and the texts.

The remaining **roughly 56%** falls into two other categories: *tadbhava* — তদ্ভব (*tôdbhôb*, "derived from that") — words that *started* in Sanskrit or Prakrit but have been modified beyond clean recognition — and *deshi* — দেশী (*deşi*, "of the land") — words of unknown or non-Aryan origin that simply exist in Bengali without any Sanskrit explanation.

That *deshi* category is where the comfort words live. <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" />. <CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" />. <CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" />. <CognateTooltip latin="danga" bengali="ডাঙা" meaning="highland, raised ground" />. The words your grandmother used every day.

---

## The Munda Layer

Linguists use the term "substrate" for the vocabulary, sounds, and grammatical features that survive in a language from an *earlier* language that was displaced. Bengali has a substantial Austroasiatic substrate, specifically from Munda languages, and a secondary substrate from Tibeto-Burman languages (the Bodo/Koch family) in the north and northeast of the region.

"Austroasiatic" is a language family that today includes the Munda languages of eastern India (Santali, Mundari, Ho) and the Mon-Khmer languages of Southeast Asia (Vietnamese, Khmer, Mon). The name signals the hypothesis that these languages once occupied a much larger territory stretching from India through Southeast Asia, before being displaced by later migrations. The Munda speakers of Jharkhand and Odisha are their westernmost living remnant in South Asia.

The following words are HIGH-confidence candidates for Munda loanwords in Bengali — these appear in serious scholarly work on Indo-Aryan substrate studies, with no plausible Sanskrit etymology and with phonological or semantic parallels in Munda languages:

| Bengali | Phonetic | Meaning | Semantic domain |
|---|---|---|---|
| ঢেঁকি | *dheki* | rice-husking lever | Food production |
| ঠাঙি / টাঙ্গি | *tangi* | axe | Tools |
| ঝাড় | *jhar* | forest, bush | Topography |
| ডাঙা | *danga* | highland, raised ground | Topography |
| হাঁড়ি | *hari* | earthen pot | Domestic objects |
| ঝিঙে | *jhinge* | ridge gourd | Food |

Notice the semantic domains. These are not words for abstract concepts. They are not words for divine attributes or celestial bodies or philosophical categories. They are words for: where the trees are, what the ground is like, what you cook in, what you eat, what you use to process grain, what you cut with. These are the words of daily survival — and they are the words that did not get replaced.

---

## The *jh-* Pattern

There is a phonological observation worth making here, with appropriate caution attached. Several proposed Munda loanwords and *deshi* words in Bengali share an initial *jh-* onset — that breathy, voiced cluster: ঝাড় (*jhar*), ঝিঙে (*jhinge*), and the food words ঝাল (*jhal*, "spicy/sharp") and ঝোল (*jhol*, "thin broth") that appear everywhere in Bengali cooking vocabulary.

The pattern is plausible as an Austroasiatic phonological inheritance. But I want to be direct about what the scholarly situation actually is: the specific etymologies of *jhāl* and *jhol* are genuinely unresolved. They are not from Sanskrit. They are possibly substrate. Their precise origin is *not yet demonstrated* to scholarly satisfaction. What can be said is that these words exist in a phonological neighborhood that looks consistent with what Munda substrate words look like. That is a pattern observation, not an etymology.

The same epistemic care applies to the onomatopoeia. ঝমঝম (*jhomjhom*), টিপটিপ (*tip tip*), গুড়গুড় (*gurgur*) — these are not loanwords in the ordinary sense. Sound-mimicry vocabulary is often independently invented in every language. But the *density* of this vocabulary in Bengali is notable. One plausible reading is that Bengali sits at the intersection of three substrate traditions — Austroasiatic (Munda), Tibeto-Burman (Bodo/Koch), and traces of North Dravidian — each independently rich in oral and sonic culture, and that this convergence produced a language with an unusual appetite for capturing texture and sound in words.

---

## Echo-Words: A Morphological Fingerprint

One feature of Bengali that linguists point to as likely Austroasiatic in origin is the *echo-word* or reduplication pattern. Bengali has a productive construction where any noun can be approximately doubled with a phonetically altered second copy to mean "X and things of that type":

ঘোড়াটোড়া (*ghora-tora*, from *ghora*, "horse") — "horses and such things"

কাপড়চোপড় (*kapur-chopur*, from *kapur*, "cloth") — "clothes and such things"

মাছটাছ (*mach-tach*, from *mach*, "fish") — "fish and similar things"

This pattern — technically called echo compounding — is highly characteristic of Austroasiatic languages and is found across Munda and Mon-Khmer language families. It is not a Sanskrit or Indo-Aryan feature. It got absorbed so deeply into Bengali morphology that speakers generate new echo-pairs spontaneously, without thinking. It is not a loan of *vocabulary*; it is a loan of *grammatical structure*. The Munda speakers left their morphological DNA inside the language even after the language itself was gone.

Bengali also has what linguists call numeral classifiers — the particles you must use when counting certain types of nouns. In English, you say "three fish." In Bengali, you say তিনটে মাছ (*tinte mach*) — literally "three [classifier for objects] fish." This classifier system (*ṭā*, *ṭi*, *khānā*, *jon*, and others) is another feature not found in Sanskrit but common across Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic language families. One more structural inheritance from the substrate.

---

## The Odia Connection

A brief note that will matter more in later posts: the thin-sour-spicy food axis I described — *jhol*, *jhal*, *tok* (টক, "sour"), *ombol* (অম্বল, "sourness; a sour preparation") — has structural cognates in Odia as well. The same thin broth, the same fermented-fish sensibility, the same balance of sourness and heat appear in Odia cooking with similar vocabulary. This is not a case of one language borrowing from the other recently. It is a shared inheritance — a food culture that was already present across the Bengal-Odisha-northeastern coastal zone before either Bengali or Odia existed as distinct literary languages, and that persisted in kitchens long after the prestige languages changed. The sour-thin-fish axis is an eastern substrate tradition, visible across Odia, Bengali, and northeastern cuisines, older than any of them.

---

## The Familiar Is the Ancient

Let me end here, with the inversion at the heart of this series.

When we think about what is "authentically Bengali," we typically reach for the high cultural markers: Tagore, the Charyapadas (the approximately tenth- to twelfth-century Buddhist devotional songs that are the oldest surviving Bengali literature), the literary tradition, the philosophical vocabulary. These feel like the *deep* Bengali. But linguistically, they are the *recent* layer — they are the Indo-Aryan stratum, the Sanskritic inheritance, the prestige vocabulary that arrived with a particular cultural-religious formation and was recorded in texts because texts survive.

The *deepest* Bengali — the oldest, the most continuous — is in the proverb about the <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" /> that keeps pounding paddy even in heaven. It is in the *jol-danga* game where the flood is always coming and you scramble for high ground. It is in the <CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" /> and the <CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" /> and the thin sour fish broth that has no name in any language that came from the northwest. These words are older than the language itself. They are the vocabulary of people whose names we do not know, whose own languages are gone, but whose daily routines — pounding rice, cooking fish in thin sour broth, reading the ground for where the flood would not reach — survived inside the language that displaced them.

The words that feel most Bengali are probably the least Bengali in origin.

That is where this series begins.

মাছের ঝোল — এই নামটা নিয়ে বসলে একটা অদ্ভুত জিনিস হয়। যারা ছোটবেলা থেকে এই রান্না খেয়েছেন, তাদের কাছে ব্যাখ্যার দরকার নেই। আর যারা খাননি, তাদের কাছে কোনো বাংলায় বা ইংরেজিতেই ঠিকঠাক বোঝানো যায় না।

কারি? না, সেটা হয় ঘন, মশলাদার। স্যুপ? না, সেটা ইউরোপীয় ব্যাপার। ঝোল হলো পাতলা — প্রায় স্বচ্ছ। একটু টক। মাছ — সবসময় মিষ্টি জলের, সবসময় একটু কাঁটাওয়ালা, সবসময় ঠিক — সেই পাতলা ঝোলে সবে ধরে থাকে। টকটা আসতে পারে তেঁতুল থেকে, বা আমচুর থেকে, বা সরষে তেলের ঝাঁজ থেকে। আর পূর্ববঙ্গের ঘরে এর নিচে থাকে শিদল — একটা গাঁজানো শুঁটকির পেস্ট যেটা ভিয়েতনামি রান্নায় ফিশ সস যেভাবে কাজ করে সেইভাবে কাজ করে: অদৃশ্য, অপরিহার্য, পূর্বপুরুষের।

এই ঝোল থেকেই এই লেখামালার শুরু। ব্যাকরণ বা পণ্ডিতি দিয়ে নয় — একটা বাটির সামনে বসে যেটার কোনো ইন্দো-আর্য ব্যাখ্যা নেই। বাংলা সংস্কৃতির গভীরতম স্তরগুলো যেখানে আমরা সাধারণত খুঁজি সেখানে নেই। সেগুলো আছে রান্নাঘরে। শরীরে। সেই সব শব্দে যেগুলো সবচেয়ে বেশি বাংলা মনে হয় — কিন্তু আমার যুক্তি হলো সেই শব্দগুলোই এই ভাষার সবচেয়ে পুরনো অ-বাংলা শব্দ।

---

## আরামের শব্দ

কিছু শব্দের একটা তালিকা দিই — যেগুলো হাড়ের ভেতর পর্যন্ত পরিচিত, শেখা নয় বরং শরীরে মিশে গেছে:

<CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" /> — গ্রামে প্রতিদিন সকালে ধান ভানার কাজে লাগে এই লম্বা কাঠের যন্ত্র, পা দিয়ে চালাতে হয়। শহুরে ছেলে হিসেবে ঢেঁকি হাতে নাড়িনি, কিন্তু প্রবাদটা জানি: *ঢেঁকি স্বর্গে গেলেও ধান ভানে*। কিছু জিনিস তার স্বভাব ছাড়ে না।

পটল — এই সবজিটা এতটাই বাংলার যে দিল্লির কাউকে বোঝাতে গেলে আটকে যেতে হয়।

<CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" /> — আরেকটা। ইশারা করা যায়। মঙ্গলবারের দুপুরে কেমন লাগে সেটা অনুবাদ হয় না।

<CognateTooltip latin="danga" bengali="ডাঙা" meaning="highland, raised ground above flood line" /> — আমরা ছোটবেলায় স্কুলের মাঠে জল-ডাঙা খেলতাম। একজন জল, বাকিরা ডাঙা খুঁজছে — যেকোনো উঁচু জায়গা। বাংলার সমস্ত বন্যার ভয়, একটা শিশুর খেলায় আটকে।

<CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" /> — রান্না, জল রাখা, শস্য সংরক্ষণ — মাটির পাত্রের এই নামটাই বাংলার সংসারজগতের সবচেয়ে ঘরোয়া শব্দ।

আর তারপর আছে ধ্বনি-অনুকরণের জগৎ:

ঝমঝম — টিনের ছাদে ভারী বর্ষার শব্দ।

টিপটিপ — গুঁড়ি গুঁড়ি বৃষ্টির শব্দ, যেন ক্ষমা চাইছে।

গুড়গুড় — দূরের মেঘের গুমগুম।

এই শব্দগুলো সংস্কৃত অভিধানে নেই। ইন্দো-আর্য ব্যুৎপত্তিতে ব্যাখ্যা হয় না। এগুলো অকাট্য বাংলা মনে হয় — হিন্দিভাষীর কাছে প্রথমবার অপরিচিত, অনুবাদের অযোগ্য।

আর এটাই হলো সূত্র।

---

## মূল প্রশ্নটা

এই প্রথম পর্বে যে যুক্তিটা করতে চাই সেটা এই লেখামালার সব কিছুকে নতুন আলোয় দেখাবে:

**যে শব্দগুলো সবচেয়ে বেশি বাংলা মনে হয়, সেগুলো সম্ভবত এই ভাষার সবচেয়ে পুরনো অ-বাংলা শব্দ।**

আরামের শব্দ, রান্নাঘরের শব্দ, মাটি আর বৃষ্টির শব্দ — এগুলো অবশিষ্ট। এগুলো সেই মানুষদের ভাষার ভূত-ভাণ্ডার যারা হাজার হাজার বছর বাংলায় ছিলেন ইন্দো-আর্য ভাষীদের আসার আগে।

ভাষা বদলের সময় যা হয় সেটা বোঝা দরকার। ধর্ম, আইন, দর্শন, জ্যোতির্বিদ্যার মতো মর্যাদার ক্ষেত্রের শব্দ দ্রুত পালটে যায় — অভিজাতরা নতুন ভাষার শব্দ নেন, পুরনো শব্দ এক-দুই প্রজন্মেই মুছে যায়। কিন্তু রান্নাঘরের শব্দ আলাদা। রান্না করতে করতে বড়রা ছোটদের শেখায় — পাঠশালায় নয়, মন্দিরে নয়। হাঁড়িটা তুলে আনতে বলার সময় নামটা বলা হয়, শেখানো হয় না, দেখানো হয়। মর্যাদার শব্দ বাঁচে গ্রন্থে। রান্নাঘরের শব্দ বাঁচে শরীরে।

ধান ভানার যন্ত্রের সংস্কৃত শব্দ হলো উলূখল (পাথরের খাল) ও মুসল (মুগুর)। এই শব্দ গ্রন্থে বেঁচে আছে। কিন্তু সব বাংলাভাষী গ্রামের মানুষ সেই যন্ত্রকে <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" /> বলেছেন। আর ঢেঁকি সংস্কৃত নয়। এর কোনো সংস্কৃত ব্যুৎপত্তি নেই। ভাষাতাত্ত্বিকদের মতে এটি অস্ট্রো-এশিয়াটিক-ভাষীদের থেকে বংশানুক্রমিকভাবে পাওয়া শব্দ — যে মানুষরা সাঁওতাল, মুণ্ডারি, হো-র মতো ভাষা বলতেন। তাদের মৌখিক ঐতিহ্য সেটাই বলে। জেনেটিক গবেষণাও একমত হচ্ছে।

---

## শব্দভাণ্ডারের হিসাব

ভাষাবিদ সুনীতিকুমার চট্টোপাধ্যায় ১৯২৬ সালে তাঁর বিশাল গ্রন্থ *Origin and Development of the Bengali Language* প্রকাশ করেন। তাঁর শব্দভাণ্ডার বিশ্লেষণে একটা তথ্য উঠে আসে যেটা একটু বসে ভাবার মতো:

বাংলার প্রায় **৪৪%** শব্দ তৎসম — সংস্কৃত থেকে সরাসরি নেওয়া। ধর্ম। কর্ম। বৃক্ষ। এগুলো মর্যাদার ঋণশব্দ, ব্রাহ্মণিক স্তর, পুরোহিত ও গ্রন্থের সঙ্গে আসা শব্দ।

বাকি প্রায় **৫৬%** দুটি ভাগে পড়ে: তদ্ভব — সংস্কৃত বা প্রাকৃত থেকে শুরু হয়ে এতটাই বদলে গেছে যে সংস্কৃত চেনা যায় না — এবং দেশী — অজ্ঞাত বা অনার্য উৎসের শব্দ যেগুলো কোনো সংস্কৃত ব্যাখ্যা ছাড়াই বাংলায় আছে।

সেই দেশী শ্রেণিতেই আরামের শব্দগুলো। <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" />। <CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" />। <CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" />। <CognateTooltip latin="danga" bengali="ডাঙা" meaning="highland, raised ground" />। আপনার ঠাকুরমা প্রতিদিন যে শব্দগুলো বলতেন।

---

## মুণ্ডা স্তর

ভাষাতাত্ত্বিকরা "সাবস্ট্রেট" শব্দটা ব্যবহার করেন সেই শব্দভাণ্ডার, উচ্চারণ এবং ব্যাকরণের বৈশিষ্ট্যগুলোর জন্য যেগুলো একটি *পুরনো* ভাষা থেকে নতুন ভাষায় টিকে থাকে। বাংলার একটি শক্তিশালী অস্ট্রো-এশিয়াটিক সাবস্ট্রেট আছে — বিশেষত মুণ্ডা ভাষা থেকে — এবং উত্তর ও উত্তর-পূর্বে তিব্বতো-বর্মান ভাষা থেকে একটি গৌণ সাবস্ট্রেটও আছে।

নিচের শব্দগুলো বাংলায় মুণ্ডা ঋণশব্দের উচ্চ-আস্থার প্রার্থী:

| বাংলা | উচ্চারণ | অর্থ | অর্থগত ক্ষেত্র |
|---|---|---|---|
| ঢেঁকি | ধেকি | ধান ভানার যন্ত্র | খাদ্য উৎপাদন |
| ঠাঙি / টাঙ্গি | টাঙ্গি | কুড়াল | যন্ত্রপাতি |
| ঝাড় | ঝার | জঙ্গল, ঝোপ | ভূগোল |
| ডাঙা | ডাঙা | উচ্চভূমি | ভূগোল |
| হাঁড়ি | হাড়ি | মাটির পাত্র | গৃহস্থালি |
| ঝিঙে | ঝিঙে | ঝিঙে সবজি | খাদ্য |

লক্ষ্য করুন অর্থগত ক্ষেত্রগুলো। বিমূর্ত ধারণার শব্দ নয়। দৈনন্দিন বেঁচে থাকার শব্দ — এগুলোই বদলায়নি।

---

## ঝ-দিয়ে শুরুর ধরন

একটা ধ্বনিতাত্ত্বিক পর্যবেক্ষণ, সতর্কতার সঙ্গে বলছি: বেশ কিছু প্রস্তাবিত মুণ্ডা ঋণশব্দ এবং দেশী শব্দে প্রথমে 'ঝ-' আছে: ঝাড়, ঝিঙে, ঝাল, ঝোল। এই ধরনটা অস্ট্রো-এশিয়াটিক ধ্বনি-উত্তরাধিকার হিসেবে সম্ভব। কিন্তু সৎ কথা হলো: ঝাল ও ঝোলের নির্দিষ্ট ব্যুৎপত্তি এখনও অসমাধান। সেগুলো সংস্কৃত নয়। হয়তো সাবস্ট্রেট। কিন্তু পাণ্ডিত্যিকভাবে এখনও প্রমাণিত নয়।

একই সতর্কতা ধ্বনি-অনুকরণের ক্ষেত্রে: ঝমঝম, টিপটিপ, গুড়গুড় — এগুলো সাধারণ অর্থে ঋণশব্দ নয়। প্রতিটি ভাষাই স্বাধীনভাবে শব্দ-অনুকরণী শব্দ তৈরি করে। কিন্তু বাংলায় এই ধরনের শব্দের *ঘনত্ব* লক্ষণীয়। একটি সম্ভাব্য ব্যাখ্যা: বাংলা তিনটি সাবস্ট্রেট ঐতিহ্যের সংযোগস্থলে দাঁড়িয়ে — অস্ট্রো-এশিয়াটিক, তিব্বতো-বর্মান, এবং উত্তর দ্রাবিড়ের ছায়া — প্রতিটিই মৌখিক ও শ্রুতি-সংস্কৃতিতে সমৃদ্ধ।

---

## প্রতিধ্বনি-শব্দ: ব্যাকরণের ছাপ

ভাষাবিদরা বাংলার একটি বৈশিষ্ট্যকে সম্ভবত অস্ট্রো-এশিয়াটিক উৎসের বলেন: প্রতিধ্বনি-শব্দ বা দ্বিরুক্তি। বাংলায় যেকোনো বিশেষ্যকে ধ্বনি-পরিবর্তিত দ্বিতীয় অনুলিপি দিয়ে "X এবং সেই জাতীয় জিনিস" বোঝানো যায়:

ঘোড়াটোড়া — ঘোড়া ও তার মতো জিনিস

কাপড়চোপড় — কাপড় ও সেই সব

মাছটাছ — মাছ ও সেরকম

এই ধরনটা — যাকে প্রতিধ্বনি সমাস বলা হয় — অস্ট্রো-এশিয়াটিক ভাষায় অত্যন্ত বৈশিষ্ট্যপূর্ণ। এটা সংস্কৃত বা ইন্দো-আর্যের বৈশিষ্ট্য নয়। এটা বাংলা ব্যাকরণের এত গভীরে মিশে গেছে যে বক্তারা স্বতঃস্ফূর্তভাবে নতুন জুটি তৈরি করেন। এটা শব্দ-ঋণ নয়; এটা *ব্যাকরণ-কাঠামো-ঋণ*। মুণ্ডা-ভাষীরা তাদের ভাষার ব্যাকরণিক ডিএনএ বাংলার ভেতরে রেখে গেছেন, ভাষাটা নিজে চলে যাওয়ার পরেও।

## ওড়িয়া সংযোগ

একটা সংক্ষিপ্ত নোট: পাতলা-টক-ঝাল খাবারের অক্ষটা — ঝোল, ঝাল, টক, অম্বল — ওড়িয়া রান্নায়ও সমান্তরাল আছে। একই পাতলা ঝোল, একই গাঁজানো মাছের অনুভব, একই টক ও ঝালের মিশ্রণ। এটা এক ভাষার অন্য ভাষা থেকে সাম্প্রতিক ঋণের বিষয় নয়। এটা ভাগ করা উত্তরাধিকার — বাংলা-ওড়িশা-উত্তর-পূর্ব উপকূলীয় অঞ্চলজুড়ে একটি খাদ্যসংস্কৃতি যা বাংলা বা ওড়িয়া কোনোটাই স্বতন্ত্র সাহিত্যিক ভাষা হওয়ার আগে থেকে ছিল।

## পরিচিতটাই প্রাচীন

এই লেখামালার কেন্দ্রে যে উলটো কথাটা আছে, সেটা দিয়ে শেষ করি।

"আদি বাংলা" বলতে আমরা সাধারণত উঁচু সাংস্কৃতিক চিহ্নগুলো ধরি: রবীন্দ্রনাথ, চর্যাপদ (আনুমানিক দশম থেকে দ্বাদশ শতাব্দীর বৌদ্ধ পদাবলি, বাংলার প্রাচীনতম টিকে থাকা সাহিত্য), সাহিত্যের ধারা। এগুলো *গভীর* বাংলার মতো মনে হয়। কিন্তু ভাষাতাত্ত্বিকভাবে এগুলো *সাম্প্রতিক* স্তর — ইন্দো-আর্য স্তর, সংস্কৃতীয় উত্তরাধিকার।

*গভীরতম* বাংলা হলো সেই প্রবাদ: <CognateTooltip latin="dheki" bengali="ঢেঁকি" meaning="rice-husking lever" /> স্বর্গে গেলেও ধান ভানে। জল-ডাঙা খেলায়, যেখানে বন্যা সবসময় আসছে এবং আপনি উঁচু জায়গার জন্য দৌড়াচ্ছেন। <CognateTooltip latin="hari" bengali="হাঁড়ি" meaning="earthen pot" />তে, <CognateTooltip latin="jhinge" bengali="ঝিঙে" meaning="ridge gourd" />তে, সেই পাতলা টক মাছের ঝোলে যার কোনো উত্তর-পশ্চিম থেকে আসা নাম নেই। এই শব্দগুলো ভাষার চেয়েও পুরনো। এগুলো সেই মানুষদের শব্দভাণ্ডার যাদের নাম আমরা জানি না, যাদের নিজের ভাষা হারিয়ে গেছে, কিন্তু যাদের প্রতিদিনের কাজ — ধান ভানা, পাতলা টক ঝোলে মাছ রান্না, বন্যার সামনে উঁচু জমি বোঝা — সেই ভাষার ভেতরে বেঁচে আছে যে ভাষা তাদের সরিয়ে দিয়েছিল।

যে শব্দগুলো সবচেয়ে বেশি বাংলা মনে হয়, সেগুলো উৎসে সম্ভবত সবচেয়ে কম বাংলা।

এখান থেকেই এই লেখামালার শুরু।
